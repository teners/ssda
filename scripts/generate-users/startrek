TEASER

FADE IN:

1 EXT. SPACE - STARSHIP (OPTICAL)

The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC 1701-D traveling at warp speed
through space.

PICARD V.O.
Captain's log, stardate 42353.7.
Our destination is planet Cygnus
IV, beyond which lies the great
unexplored mass of the galaxy.

2 OTHER INTRODUCTORY ANGLES (OPTICAL)

on the gigantic new Enterprise NCC 1701-D.

PICARD V.O.
My orders are to examine Farpoint,
a starbase built there by the
inhabitants of that world.
Meanwhile ...

3 INT. ENGINE ROOM

Huge, with a giant wall diagram showing the immensity
of this Galaxy Class starship.

PICARD V.O.
(continuing)
... I am becoming better
acquainted with my new command,
this Galaxy Class U.S.S.
Enterprise.

4 CLOSER ON VESSEL DIAGRAM

Showing the details and size of this enormous starship.

PICARD V.O.
I am still somewhat in awe of its
size and complexity.

5 INT. LOUNGE DECK

With its huge windows revealing the immense span of the
Starship's outer surface.
5 CONTINUED:

PICARD V.O.
(continuing)
... my crew we are short in
several key positions, most
notably ...

6 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

PICARD, TROI, and DATA seated in the command area.
Starfleet LIEUTENANT WORF, a young Klingon, is at the
"Ops" station and a SUPERNUMERARY is at "Conn".

PICARD V.O.
(continuing)
... a first officer, but I am
informed that a highly experienced
man, one Commander William Riker,
will be waiting to join our ship
when we reach our Cygnus IV
destination.

7 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND DATA

As Picard turns to Data:

PICARD
You will agree, Data, that
Starfleet's instructions are
difficult?

DATA
Difficult ... how so? Simply
solve the mystery of Farpoint
Station.

PICARD
(smiles)
As simple as that.

TROI
Farpoint Station. Even the name
sounds mysterious.

PICARD
The problem, Data, is that another
life form built that base. How
do I negotiate a friendly
agreement for Starfleet to use
it while at the same time snoop
around finding how and why they
built it?


7 CONTINUED:

DATA
Inquiry ... the word snoop ... ?

PICARD
Data, how can you be programmed
as a virtual encyclopedia of human
information without knowing a
simple word like snoop?

DATA
Possibility ... a kind of human
behavior I was not designed to
emulate?

It is all Troi can do to keep from smiling.

PICARD
It means 'to spy, to sneak' ...

DATA
(interrupting;
delighted)
Ah! To seek covertly, to go
stealthily, to slink, slither ...

PICARD
(wanting to cut it off)
Exactly, yes ...

DATA
... to glide, creep, skulk,
pussyfoot, gumshoe ...

Data trails off his words, finally becoming aware of
the annoyance registering on Picard's face. Troi cannot
keep back the smile now ... then suddenly her face is
contorted in pain.

TROI
Captain ... I'm sensing a ... a
powerful mind ...

Interrupted by the sound of a BRIDGE ALARM.

8 WIDER ANGLE

All checking their consoles, puzzled at readings they're
getting.

WORF
Something strange on the detector
circuits ...

8 CONTINUED:

OVERLAPPED by an ever more compelling SECOND BRIDGE
ALARM (similar to the old naval HONKING SOUND) begins
to sound. At the same time, the main viewer FLICKERS
and an unusual SHINING, SPARKLING GRID SHAPE APPEARS
stretching across the whole of the galaxy ahead of them.

9 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND GRID (OPTICAL)

Emphasizing the incredibly SHINING GRID which the
Enterprise is approaching. Seeming impossibly large,
yet in some ways as delicate as a spiderweb, it is
composed of interlocking geometrical shapes.

10 INT. BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES

Data is looking up from his command position console,
showing as much alarm as we'll ever see on his face.

DATA
It registers as solid, Captain...

TROI
Or an incredibly powerful
forcefield. But if we collide
with either ...

PICARD
(to Conn)
Go to Condition Yellow. And shut
off that damned noise.

Conn turns OFF honking sound. Picard is taking time to
check all readings but we're now coming very close to
the strange grid.

WORF
Shields and deflectors, up, sir.

Milking the drama of approaching collision. Then,
conversationally:

PICARD
Reverse power, full stop.

CONN
Controls to full stop, sir.

The strange shimmering GRID on the viewer is now very
close to us as Enterprise movement stops.

CONN
Now reading full stop, sir.

10 CONTINUED:

Overlapped by something akin to a ROLLING THUNDER STORM
accompanied by a BRILLIANT AND SUSTAINED FLASH OF LIGHT
ON THE BRIDGE to the side of Picard. The light burst
physically shakes all bridge crew for an instant, then
RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A HUMAN SIZE FIGURE standing at
that point on the bridge. As the bridge crew's eyes
adjust, it does indeed appear to be a human ... but one
dressed and posturing as an Elizabethan era sea captain
complete with Sir Walter Raleigh type "court dress",
complete with neck ruffles, lace, leg stockings,
ceremonial sword, etc. Now and later, we shall know
this life form as "Q".

11 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

as "Q" (Elizabethan) makes a formal bow (of that same
era) to Picard. At which the turbolift doors snap open
and TWO SECURITY CREW members start to ENTER, led by
Security and Weapons Officer NATASHA YAR. However, "Q"
merely gives a nod in that direction and a miniature of
the space grid outside APPEARS AT THE TURBOLIFT
ENTRANCE, barring the security team's entrance and
CLOSES THE TURBOLIFT DOORS. Then "Q" turns toward
Picard.

"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
You are notified that your kind
has infiltrated the galaxy too
far already. You are directed
to return to your own solar system
immediately.

12 ANGLE TO INCLUDE OPS AND CONN

We will see Conn stealthily, carefully reaching to the
small phaser on his belt.

PICARD
That's quite a directive. Would
you mind identifying what you are?

"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
We call ourselves "the Q". Or
you may call me that; it's all
much the same thing.
(indicating costume)
And I have presented myself to
you as a fellow ship captain so
that you will better understand
me.
(indicates)
Go back from where you...

13 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

Interrupted by Conn drawing his phaser. But "Q" barely
nods toward Conn at which a FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE
envelopes that bridge crewman, and we HEAR THE BRIEF
BEGINNINGS OF A SCREAM as Conn falls with the SOUND of
a frozen hard object striking the deck. Picard comes
to his feet, ignoring "Q" as:

"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
Stay where you are!

14 EMPHASIZING PICARD

Who is clearly very angry as he kneels at the prone form
of Conn who appears to have been instantly frozen solid.
Troi hurries INTO SHOT kneeling too. There is even
white evaporation vapor rising up from the body.

PICARD
Data, call medics!

TROI
He's frozen. Can you feel the
cold?

Picard grabs up Conn's phaser from the deck (reversing
it, wisely), stands and puts it under "Q's" nose.

PICARD
He would not have injured you!
(indicates phaser)
Do you understand this; the stun
setting?

"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
Knowing humans as you do, Captain,
would you want to be captured
helpless by them?
(moves closer)
Now, go back or you will certainly
die!

FADE OUT:

PART ONE

FADE IN:

15 EXT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE AND GRID (OPTICAL)

Appropriate THEME MUSIC with spaceship hanging
motionless, still facing the mysterious SHIMMERING GRID
that stretches in front of it from galaxy horizon to
horizon.

16 INTO. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING CONN'S FORM

In the b.g. on a floating stretcher Conn is being taken
to the turbolift, advanced medical emergency aids are
attached to his body.

PICARD
Is he still alive?

MEDIC
For now. We'll do our best, sir.

17 EMPHASIZING "Q" (OPTICAL)

Ignoring the previous, intent instead on inspecting his
Elizabethan costume as Picard comes up to him.

"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
Your little centuries go by so
rapidly, Captain. Perhaps you'll
understand this better.

The Visitor moves his hand slightly. We hear the same
ROLLING THUNDER SOUND. Another BLINDING LIGHT FLASH
and his body remains the same humanoid face and figure
as with the Elizabethan dress, but now the green
officer's uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps. Over his
jacket pocket three rows of medals and his narrow
garrison cap shows the bars of a Captain.

"Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN)
Actually, the issue at stake is
patriotism. You must return to
your world and put an end to the
communists. All it takes is a
few good men.

PICARD
What? That nonsense is centuries
behind us!

17 CONTINUED:

"Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN)
But you can't deny Captain, that
you're still a dangerous, savage
child-race.

PICARD
Most certainly I deny it. I agree
that we still were when ...
(indicating)
... humans wore costumes like that
four hundred years ago...

"Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN)
At which time you slaughtered
millions in silly arguments about
how to divide the resources of
your little world. And four
hundred years before that you were
murdering each other in quarrels
over tribal god-images. And since
there have been no indications
that humans will ever change
.....

PICARD
But even as far back as... !
(indicates)
... that costume, we had begun to
make rapid progress.

"Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN)
Oh? Shall we review your "rapid
progress"?

18 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

The "Q" visitor moves a hand again to create THE SAME
SOUNDS and the SAME BLINDING FLASH, producing the same
human image but this time unshaven and with an UGLY
AUTOMATION LOOK AND IN THE UNIFORM OF A MILITARY OFFICER
FROM THE MID 21st CENTURY WARS. Q's voice sounds a bit
drugged now as he eyes his new costume.

"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
(interrupting)
Rapid progress to where humans
learned to control their military
with drugs.

19 ANGLE INCLUDING OPS POSITION

As Worf gets a message and turns toward Picard.

19 CONTINUED:

WORF
Sir, sickbay reports that
Lieutenant Graham's condition is
better.

All have turned toward Worf, showing relief.

"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
Concern for one's comrade. How
touching.

WORF
(indicates "Q")
And now, sir, a personal request.
Permission to clean up the bridge?

Picard shakes head, stares Worf down when he seems about
to protest. Meanwhile Tasha has come to her feet too:

TASHA
Lieutenant Worf is right, sir.
As Security Chief I can't just
stand here and ....

PICARD
Yes, you can, Tasha.

During this, "Q" has withdrawn a slender tube attached
to his 21st Century uniform, makes an adjustment which
lets a round pill roll into his mouth and bites down
on it with a "POP" SOUND.

"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
Ah, yes... better!
(deep breath, feeling
it)
Then later, on finally reaching
deep space, humans of course found
enemies to fight out there too.
And to broaden those struggles....
(indicating Worf and
Tasha)
.... you again found allies to
permit still more murdering and
all over again the same old story.

19 CONTINUED: (2)

PICARD
(interrupting; angry)
No! The most dangerous 'same old
story' is the one we're meeting
now! Those who go on
misinformation, half-information,
self-righteous life forms who are
eager not to learn but to
prosecute, to judge anything they
don't understand or can't
tolerate.

"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
What an interesting idea.
Prosecute and judge?

CAMERA CENTERS ON "Q" as he absorbs what Picard has
said. He takes a step or two, turns.

"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
(continuing)
And suppose it turns out we
understand you humans only too
well?

PICARD
We've no fear of what the true
facts about us will reveal.

"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
The facts about you? Splendid,
splendid! You are a veritable
fountain of good ideas.
(smiling; pleasant)
There are preparations to make,
Captain, but when I return...

"Q" gives a 21st Century salute to Picard.

"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
(continuing)
... we will proceed exactly as you
suggest!

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT and the alien visitor is gone.

20 WIDE ANGLE ON BRIDGE

It takes a moment to accept the fact "Q" is really gone
then Worf turns to Picard.

20 CONTINUED:

WORF
Sir... respectfully submit our only
choice is to fight. If we
Klingons understand anything, it
is the meaning of that kind of
talk.

TASHA
My sentiments too, sir. Fight or
try to escape.

21 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD

Turning to Troi:

PICARD
Sense anything, Commander?

TROI
(shakes head)
Its mind is much too powerful,
sir. And frightening. Concur we
avoid further contact if possible!

22 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD

Clearly he has to come up with something. He reflects
for a moment more, then makes up his mind, turns to
Troi.

PICARD
From this point, no station
aboard, repeat no station, for
any reason will make use of
signals, transmission or intercom.
(crossing quickly to
Ops and Conn)
We'll try to take them by
surprise.
(to Worf)
Inform engineering to make ready
for maximum acceleration. We'll
find out what this Galaxy Class
can do.

WORF
Aye, sir.

As Worf stands and hurries off, Picard turns to Data.

22 CONTINUED:

PICARD
Records search, Data. Results
of detaching the Saucer Section
at high warp speeds.

Data quickly draws on his memory.

DATA
Inadvisable at any warp speed,
sir.

PICARD
Search theoretical.

DATA
(thinking; then)
It is possible, sir. But
absolutely no error margin.

Picard nods and stands, RAISES VOICE:

PICARD
Attention bridge crew!

23 VARIOUS ANGLES

Picard waits until all are turned toward him.

PICARD
(continuing)
Using print-out only, notify all
decks to prepare for maximum
acceleration. Maximum, you're
entitled to know, means we'll be
pushing our engines well past
safety limits. Our hope is to
surprise whatever that is out
there, try to outrun it.
(looks around, then)
Our only other option would be
to put tail between our legs and
return to Earth as they demand.

24 INT. ENGINE ROOM - TRAVELING WITH WORF

As he takes us into WIDE CAMERA ANGLE, aiming both for
a feeling of the starship's huge size and enormous
power.

25 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

Worf nodding at a reading which an Engineer shows him,
then EXITING to return to the bridge. Meanwhile,
engineering personnel work at their controls and a LOW
PITCHED WHINE quickly works itself up into a DEAFENING
HIGH PITCHED SHRIEK while ENERGY DISPLAYS APPEAR AT MAIN
ENGINE CONNECTIONS.

26 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

Showing both the Enterprise and the mysterious grid.

27 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLES INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER

Worf enters bridge from turbolift, crossing to his
position.

WORF
Engine room ready, sir.

Picard stands behind Data who is at the Conn position.

TROI
The board shows 'green', Captain.
All go!

Picard moving back to his command position as:

PICARD
Stand by...
(takes his seat, checks
bridge, then)
ENGAGE!

The entire bridge SHUDDERS under a SCREAM OF POWER as
we

CUT TO:

28 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

Suddenly into maximum warp, the energy release
momentarily DISTORTING BOTH THE ALIEN GRID AND THE STARS
IN SIGHT AROUND IT. When the EFFECT is over, the
starship has turned, seeming to almost brush against
the mysterious grid, and is then racing away from it.

29 ANGLE EMPHASIZING GRID (OPTICAL)

With Enterprise in b.g. at warp speed, escaping. Then
the 'grid' suddenly shrinks in size, growing brighter
as it coalesces together INTO THE SHAPE OF A BRIGHTLY
COLORED SPINNING SHAPE which now races after the
Enterprise.

30 INT. BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES

The faces of the bridge crew reflect the fact that
Enterprise is at very high warp speed and continuing
to accelerate into even higher warp.

WORF
Velocity warp nine point two.

DATA
Heading, 351 Mark 11, sir.

PICARD
Steady on that.

TASHA
The hostile is now giving chase,
sir. Accelerating fast.

WORF
We're now at Warp nine point
three, sir. Which takes us past
the red line, sir.

PICARD
Continue accelerating.
(to Troi)
Counselor, at this point I'm open
even to guesses about what we've
just met.

TROI
(considers, then)
It... it felt like something beyond
what we'd consider a 'life form'.

PICARD
'Beyond'?

TROI
Very, very advanced, sir. Or...
(considers)
Or certainly, very, very
different!

30 CONTINUED:

WORF
(with emphasis now)
Sir, we're at warp nine point
four.

TASHA
Hostile is now beginning to
overtake us, sir.

PICARD
Are you sure?

DATA
Hostile's velocity is already warp
nine point six, sir. Shall I
put them on main viewer?

PICARD
(nods)
Reverse angle on viewer.

31 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER

VIEWER IMAGE SHIMMERS into reverse view, which is much
the same as the forward view except for ONE BLINKING
POINT OF LIGHT AT IMAGE CENTER.

DATA
Magnifying viewer image.

ANOTHER VIEWER SHIMMER with the CENTER POINT OF LIGHT
BECOMING THE SPINNING COALESCENCE seen earlier. It's
still far away, tiny in size, but will grow in size
during later SCENES.

32 VARIOUS ANGLES

as needed.

TASHA
Hostile's velocity now at nine
point seven, sir.

PICARD
Ops, inform Engineering we need
more!

DATA
Engine room attempting to comply,
sir. But they caution us...

32 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(interrupting; to Data)
Go to yellow alert!

Data hits a control and the Yellow Alert ALARM SOUNDS
FIVE TIMES. Then Picard turns to Tasha.

PICARD
(to Tasha)
Arm photon torpedoes, Weapons
Station. Place them on ready
status.

TASHA
Torpedoes to ready, sir.

Picard is aware of the concerned glances received form
Troi and Data.

33 WIDE ANGLE

The entire bridge suddenly SHUDDERS HARD and it brings
startled looks to the faces of some of the bridge crew.
Then the motion eases.

WORF
That was a design tremor, sir.
A warning.

TASHA
Hostile now at warp nine point
eight, sir.

WORF
Our velocity is only nine point
five, sir.

DATA
Projection, sir. We may be able
to match the hostile's nine point
eight, sir. But at extreme risk.

TASHA
Now reading the hostile at warp
nine point nine, sir.

Picard stands, raising his voice to carry throughout
the bridge.

33 CONTINUED:

PICARD
Attention bridge. Print-out
message, urgent, to all decks.
(selecting the right
words)
All stations on all decks, make
ready to detach ship's saucer
section.

Some of the bridge crew is startled but all are soon
putting their consoles in order for the move. Picard
turns to Worf at 'conn' position.

PICARD
(continuing)
You will command the saucer
section, Lieutenant.

Worf comes to his feet in protest.

WORF
I am a Klingon, sir. For me to
seek escape while my captain goes
into battle....

PICARD
(interrupts hard)
You are a Starfleet officer,
Lieutenant.

WORF
(hesitates, takes seat)
Aye, sir.

PICARD
(to bridge again)
Note in ship's log that at this
startime, I am transferring
command to the Battle Bridge.
(to Data)
Make the signal, Data.

Data touches a control and we HEAR (still preserved from
surface ship days) the BUGLE CALL "BEAT TO QUARTERS"
which continues REPEATING as all bridge crew members
(except Worf) begin leaving their posts. While
SUPERNUMERARIES arrive on the turbolifts, our bridge
crew begins exiting the bridge.

FADE OUT.

PART TWO

FADE IN:

34 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

Still at high warp. We cannot see the image of the
following "hostile" (which is not magnified in this
ANGLE).

PICARD V.O.
Captain's log, stardate 42354.1.
Preparing to detach saucer
section.

35 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE

As the turbolift doors snap open, Picard and the others
ENTER the smaller, sparse and functional Battle Bridge.

PICARD V.O.
... so that families and the majority
of the ship's company...

36 INT. MONTAGE OF SAUCER SETS

Families, children, science technicians, etc., moving
into safe areas.

PICARD V.O.
(continuing)
... can seek relative safety while
our vessel's stardrive, containing
our Battle Bridge...

37 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES

Acquainting us with the smaller and more severe battle
bridge, its configuration and positions. Picard is
speaking the balance of his log entry to the microphone
at his command position.

PICARD
(continuing)
... and main armaments, will turn
back and confront the mystery that
is threatening us.
(turning to Tasha)
Lieutenant, your torpedoes must
detonate close enough to the
hostile to blind it at the moment
we separate.

37 CONTINUED:

TASHA
Understood, sir.

PICARD
Worf, this is the Captain....

38 INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING LT. WORF

The young Klingon at the Captain's command station now.

WORF
Yes Captain?

PICARD'S INTERCOM VOICE
Begin countdown....
(touches panel control)
Mark!

39 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

Traveling through space for a moment, then photon
torpedoes blasting out of the starship's aft tubes.
The torpedo pattern disappears into the distance behind
the vessel.

40 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE

All intent on what is happening as:

TROI
All decks acknowledging, sir.

DATA
Starship separation.... six, five,
four, three, two, one....

41 EXT. ENTERPRISE - ANGLES ON SEPARATION MECHANISM (OPTICAL))

As we see the largest of the assemblies begin to move,
yawning open. Other mechanisms are doing their jobs
too.... and THE MONOLITHIC STARSHIP DIVIDES INTO ITS TWO
SECTIONS.... STARDRIVE AND SAUCER MOVING APART.

PICARD V.O.
Ship's log, exact moment of
separation, stardate 42354.22.

As the Stardrive Section gets safely clear of the
saucer, it begins turning, doubling back to face the
"Q" menace. And now in the direction of that threat,
we begin to see PHOTON EXPLOSIONS in the far, far
distance.

42 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER

On which we see a tiny but SOMEWHAT LARGER IMAGE OF THE
HOSTILE VESSEL in front of which the last few PHOTON
DETONATIONS HAPPEN AND FADE AWAY.

TASHA
All torpedoes have detonated, sir.

PICARD
(to Data)
Reverse power and hold this
position.

DATA
(gives a surprised look)
Reverse power...decelerating.

TROI
That will bring them here in just
minutes, sir.

TASHA
Will we make a fight of it,
Captain? If we can at least
damage their ship....

PICARD
(indicating viewer)
Lieutenant... are you recommending
we fight a life form that can do
all those things?
(as Tasha hesitates)
I'd like to hear your advice.

TASHA
I... spoke before I thought, sir.
We should look for some way to
distract them from going after
the saucer.

DATA
All forward motion stopped, sir.

PICARD
(to Troi)
Commander, signal the following
in all languages and on all
frequencies: we surrender. State
that we are not asking for any
terms or conditions.

TROI
Aye, sir. All language forms and
frequencies.

43 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER

Where the IMAGE OF THE HOSTILE is rapidly growing in
size.

44 EXT. SPACE - U.S.S. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

As the HOSTILE IMAGE rushes down on the starship, THE
COALESCENT SHAPE OPENING UP INTO SOMETHING LIKE THE
SHIMMERING GRID WE'VE SEEN, but now as if to enclose
(and perhaps crush) the starship. A FURY OF SOUNDS like
CLANKING-SCREAMS OF METAL BEING STRESSED BEYOND ITS
LIMITS.

45 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES

As the bridge and the entire Stardrive Section is SHAKEN
ALMOST ANGRILY as the same CACOPHONY OF CLANKING-SCREAMS
continues. All bridge crew cling to their seats until
the SHAKING AND SOUNDS REACH A PEAK. As when "Q" first
appeared, FLASHES OF LIGHT BLIND US and become:

46 INT. "Q" COURTROOM - EMPHASIZING PICARD, DATA, TROI, TASHA

It is an immense courtroom meant to reflect strength
and power. (We'll discover that it dates back to the
mid-21st Century post-atomic crisis era.) Both decor
and legal procedures reflect the time when a desperate
humanity, still wounded and bleeding from nuclear war,
sought answers to its pain and problems through the
merciless strength of a new form of dictatorial
government representing neither capitalism nor
communism. Our four starship people are in old, ragged
and stained uniforms which 'demean' them as criminals.
In comparison with the gleaming steel and glass of the
rest of the courtroom, the Prisoner's Dock at which our
people sit is made of rough-hewn, hard and ugly wooden
benches. Suddenly, our Starfleet group is CAUGHT IN
A HARSH GLARING SPOTLIGHT. Data, looking around with
great curiosity, is the first to speak:

DATA
Historically intriguing, Captain.
Very, very accurate.

PICARD
(nods)
Mid-21st Century, the post-atomic
horror....

Interrupted by the SOUND OF A BELL, and CUT TO:

47 ANGLE INCLUDING MANDARIN-BAILIFF

Important, the MANDARIN-BAILIFF is not a fun figure.
Despite the Asian robe and accent, he is an important
authority figure--and his expression and actions
underscore this. He caries a slim, portable view
screen, the face of which contains scrolled information
he will occasionally refer to. Now, as he nods to a
Court Functionary who uses an ancient, oriental bell,
DOLEFULLY CLANGING to gain attention.

MANDARIN-BAILIFF
All present, make respectful
attention to honored Judge!

48 ANGLE EMPHASIZING SPECTATORS

Some still arriving, chattering in excitement, having
to be intimidated into silence by a 21st CENTURY SOLDIER,
heavily armed. Picard waves in a way indicating Data, Tasha
and Troi should not stand.

TROI
(quietly to Picard)
Careful, sir. This is not an
illusion or a dream.

PICARD
But these courts happened in our
past....

TROI
I don't understand either, but
this is real. I can feel that!

49 OTHER ANGLES AS NEEDED

A 21st Century MILITARY OFFICER moving to our Starfleet
group, leveling his automatic weapon toward them.

FUTURE MILITARY OFFICER
Get to your feet, criminals!

Our people ignore him too. "Mandarin-Bailiff" is
CLANGING THE BELL again. Data sees something,
indicates:

DATA
At least we are acquainted with
the judge, Captain.

50 ANGLE ON JUDGE

The "judge's bench" (an appropriate 21st Century design
on Chapman camera-crane) comes floating into the
courtroom. Seated in it is "Q" (JUDGE), an arrangement
which gives "his Honor" physical access to every part
and corner of this courtroom. As he floats serenely
over spectators' heads, suddenly there's the RATATATTAT
of an automatic weapon.

51 ANGLE INCLUDING MILITARY OFFICER

Just completing FIRING a warning burst at the feet of
Picard.

MILITARY OFFICER
(screaming angrily)
Attention! On your feet,
attention!

But Tasha pivoting in fast, taking the weapon and
throwing the Officer crashing to the floor. Judge's
"bench" (Camera Crane) brings "Q" INTO SCENE fast.

"Q" (JUDGE)
You are out of order!

But he's speaking to the downed military officer, not
to Tasha. Which turns out to be a sentence of death
-- carried out by a pair of Soldiers who step in,
raising their automatic weapons, FIRING at the Officer
lying on the floor. Spectators break into APPLAUSE as
the Officer slumps and lies unmoving.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(continuing)
The prisoners will not be
harmed...
(a glance at Picard)
Until they are found guilty, of
course.

Still hovering over the fallen officer, "Q" indicates
the body.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(continuing)
Dispose of that.

Picard has taken the automatic weapon from Tasha.

51 CONTINUED:

PICARD
Can we assume you mean this will
be a fair trial?

"Q" (JUDGE)
Yes, absolutely equitable.

Picard hands the weapon to "Bailiff". "Q" (JUDGE)
swings his "bench" to CENTER FRONT of the courtroom.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(continuing to
Mandarin-bailiff)
Proceed.

MANDARIN-BAILIFF
(refers to his portable
viewscreen)
Before this gracious court now
appear these humans to answer for
the multiple and grievous
savageries of their species.

Judge's "bench" swings "Q" (JUDGE) in literally
nose-to-nose with Picard.

"Q" (JUDGE)
How plead you, criminal?

DATA
If I may, Captain....
(gets a nod)
Objection, your honor. In the
year 2016, the new United Nations
declared that no Earth citizen
could be made to answer for the
crimes of their race or
forbearers.

"Q" (JUDGE)
Objection denied!

Followed by CLANGING OF BAILIFF'S BELL and CHEERS FROM
THE SPECTATORS.

52 ANGLE EMPHASIZING "Q" AND PICARD

"Q" (JUDGE)
(continuing)
This is a court of the year 2049,
by which time more 'rapid
progress' had caused all 'United
Earth' nonsense to be abolished.

52 CONTINUED:

At which point Tasha comes to her feet very angry.

PICARD
Tasha, no...

TASHA
I must... 
(to "Q")
... because I grew up on a world
that allowed things like this
court. And it was people like
these that saved me from it. I
say that this so-called court
should get down on its knees to
what Starfleet is, what it
represents...

53 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

And "Q" (JUDGE) flies INTO SCENE, gesturing toward Tasha
as he did earlier to Conn on the bridge... resulting in
the same FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE THAT ENVELOPES
HER. As Tasha goes rigid, frozen, Data supports her,
lowers her form gently to the floor as:

TROI
(shouting to "Q")
You barbarian! That girl....

"Q" gestures and the same FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE
ENVELOPS HER TOO. Picard leaps in, keeps her frozen,
rigid form from crashing down.

MANDARIN-BAILIFF
Criminals keep silence!

54 ANGLE ON PICARD

bending over Tasha, then to "Q":

PICARD
You've got a lot to learn about
humans if you think you can
torture us or frighten us into
silence.
(to Data)
Are they still alive?

DATA
Uncertain. Lieutenant Graham was
when our medics thawed him out.

54 CONTINUED:

"Q" (JUDGE) glides in closer on his "bench".

"Q" (JUDGE)
You will answer the charges!

PICARD
Or what? Or this, or worse? Or
death? I suggest you take a
better look at human history.

Spectators have begun GRUMBLING over Picard's failure
to answer "Q".

"Q" (JUDGE)
You are charged, criminals. How
plead you?

PICARD
Just a moment ago, you promised
"the prisoners will not be
harmed." We plead nothing so long
as you break your own rules.

LOUDER GRUMBLING from the Spectators now.

"Q" (JUDGE)
I suggest you center your
attention on the trial, Captain.
It may be your only hope.

PICARD
And I suggest you now may be
having second thoughts about this
trial! You're considering that
if you conduct it fairly, which
was your promise, you may lose.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(laughs)
Lose?

PICARD
Yes, even though you're judge, and
prosecutor....

"Q" (JUDGE)
(nods)
And jury.

54 CONTINUED: (2)

PICARD
(considers it; nods)
Accepted... so long as you keep
to your agreement.
(indicates Troi and
Tasha)
And assaulting prisoners is hardly
a fair trial.

55 OPTICAL ANGLE ON "Q" (OPTICAL)

Seems to be considering it. Then he looks downward,
indicates.

"Q" (JUDGE)
This is a merciful court.

"Q" waves his hand DOWNWARD TO WARD TROI AND TASHA AND
A RIPPLE OF LIGHT plays over the two women, UNFREEZING
THEM.

ANOTHER ANGLE "Q" (JUDGE)

The court very disorderly now with some spectators
standing on their benches SHOUTING as an annoyed "Q"
brings his "bench" up hovering over the heads of
everyone.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(greatly AMPLIFIED)
SILENCE!

The order is so LOUDLY AMPLIFIED that it comes near to
shaking the entire courtroom structure. The spectators
bite off their words and sink frightened into their
seats. We notice "Q" throwing a glance toward Picard
to see if the Captain is properly impressed. Then the
"bench" is lowered to allow "Q" to face Picard again.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(continued)
Continuing these proceedings, I
must caution you that legal
trickery is not permitted. This
is a court of fact!

55 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(same words; same time)
... court of fact!
(nods)
We humans know our past, even when
we're ashamed of it. I recognize
this court system as the one which
agreed with Shakespeare's
suggestion -- "Kill all the
lawyers".

"Q" (JUDGE)
(nods)
Which humans did.

PICARD
Which led to the rule: "Guilty
until proven innocent".

"Q" (JUDGE)
Of course. Bringing the innocent
to trial would be unfair.
(leaning in; voice
amplified)
YOU WILL NOW ANSWER TO THE
GRIEVOUS SAVAGERY CHARGE AGAINST
HUMANITY.

PICARD
We'll be happy to answer specific
charges. "Grievous savagery" could
mean anything.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(interrupting)
Obviously it means causing harm
to fellow creatures!

PICARD
Such as you did when you froze
a member of our bridge crew? Will
you be joining us in the dock
here?

"Q" (JUDGE)
You fool. Are you certain you
want a full disclosure of human
ugliness?
(to Mandarin-Bailiff)
So be it! Present the charges.

Mandarin-Bailiff refers to his portable view screen,
then steps forward and presents it for Picard's
examination.

55 CONTINUED: (2)

MANDARIN-BAILIFF
Criminal, you will read the
charges to the court.

Picard takes the parchment, glances through some amount
of it. Then he looks up.

PICARD
I see no charges against us, your
honor.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(pounds "bench top")
Criminal, you are out of order!

Soldiers move in, unslinging automatic weapons, of which
the barrels of two of them are now placed against Troi's
and Data's heads.

FADE OUT.

PART THREE

FADE IN:

56 INT. "Q" COURTROOM - WIDE ANGLE

Action continuing from where it ended. The gun barrels
are now pressing even closer to Troi and Data's heads
as:

"Q" (JUDGE)
Soldiers...
(indicates guns)
... you will press those triggers
if this criminal answers with any
word other than "guilty"...

57 CLOSER ANGLE

The Soldiers CLICKING FIRING ACTION TO FULL COCK. "Q"
turns to Picard.

"Q" (JUDGE)
Criminal, how plead you?

Picard takes his time, looking to his people, the
Soldiers holding the guns at their heads, then to "Q".
He seems to be taking too much time, and one of them
shifts his weight, the other begins grasping his weapon
even more firmly. Then:

PICARD
Guilty...

Picard's people can't help but show relief and even the
soldiers lighten up their stance and their grip on the
weapons, until:

PICARD
(continuing)
... provisionally so.

Surprised by this "add on", the Soldiers begin bringing
their guns in close again, looking for guidance to "Q"
who looks like he could decide either way. After
considering it for a moment:

"Q" (JUDGE)
The Court will hear the provision.

57 CONTINUED:

PICARD
We question whether this court
is abiding by its own trial
instructions. Do I have
permission to have Commander Data
repeat the record?

"Q" (JUDGE)
If this is legal trickery...

PICARD
Your own words, your Honor.
(to Data)
Exactly what followed his Honor's
statement that the prisoner would
not be harmed?

58 EMPHASIZING DATA

Taking a moment to consult his memory, then:

DATA
Yes, sir. The Captain has asked
the question...
(in Picard's VOICE)
"Can we assume this will be a fair
trial?"
(in Data VOICE)
And in reply, the judge stated...

59 OTHER ANGLES

as Data goes on.

DATA
(continuing in "Q"'s
VOICE)
"Yes, absolutely equitable."

"Q" (JUDGE)
Unacceptable testimony, entirely
unacceptable... !

59 CONTINUED:

PICARD
If your Honor pleases, there is
a simple way to clear up this
disagreement.
(waits until he has
"Q"'s attention)
We agree there is evidence to
support the court's contention
that humans have been murderous
and dangerous.
(moves in closer to "Q")
I say "have been" ... and
therefore we will respectfully
submit to a test of whether this
is presently true of humans.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(suddenly alert)
I see, I see.
(an idea forming)
And you petition the Court to
accept you and your comrades as
proof of what humanity has become.

PICARD
There should be many ways we can
be tested. We have a long mission
ahead of us...

"Q" (JUDGE)
Another brilliant suggestion,
Captain. But your test hardly
requires a 'long mission'.
(laughs)
Your immediate destination offers
more challenge than you can
possibly imagine. Yes, yes, this
Farpoint station will be an
excellent test of human worth.

Picard, like the others, is now becoming just a bit
concerned. What does lie ahead of them on Farpoint
Station?

60 ANGLE INCLUDING MANDARIN-BAILIFF

with "Q" nodding to him as the Bailiff stands, raising
his voice.

MANDARIN-BAILIFF
Stand respectfully. All present,
respectfully stand!

61 WIDE ANGLE

Spectators standing. Picard and his people coming to
their feet too.

62 EMPHASIZING "Q" AND PRISONERS (OPTICAL)

as "Q" moves his bench into position.

"Q" (JUDGE)
This trial is adjourned to allow
the criminals to be tested.

The Mandarin-bailiff LOUDLY CLANGS HIS BELL.

MANDARIN-BAILIFF
This honorable court is adjourned!

There is a smile coming onto the face of "Q" as he turns
to Picard.

"Q" (JUDGE)
Captain, you may find you are not
nearly clever enough to deal with
what lies ahead for you. It may
have been better to accept
sentence here.

"Q" WAVES TOWARD THEM, PRODUCING THE BLINDING LIGHT
EFFECT we've seen before -- and the EFFECT BECOMES:

63 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE

Picard and the others now in their normal garb and at
their regular stations, all beginning to register their
realization of where they now are.

64 ANGLES EMPHASIZING DATA, TROI, AND TASHA

Reacting to where they now find themselves. Data turns
to the Ops position.

DATA
Uh... what is present course, Ops?

The OPS OFFICER looks at Data, surprised.

OPS
(to Data)
It's exactly what the Captain
ordered, sir. Direct heading to
Farpoint Station.

64 CONTINUED:

Data has reviewed his console readings during this,
turns to Picard:

DATA
Confirm we are on that heading,
sir.

OPS
(to Data)
Know anything about Farpoint?
It sounds like a fairly dull
place.

PICARD
Actually, Ops, I've heard just
the opposite.

Picard, Data, Troi and Tasha exchange looks, then settle
back.

65 EXT. SPACE - LONG SHOT - PLANET (OPTICAL)

moving in on a yellowish ball of a planet glowing
against the black backdrop of starry space in the
reflected light of its sun. There is some cloud layer.
At this distance, the planet's land masses are vague
and indistinct.

RIKER'S VOICE
Personal log, Commander William
Riker, Star Date 42354.4, at
Farpoint Station.

66 CLOSER - ON THE PLANETS AND THE USS HOOD (OPTICAL)

An older class starship (the USS Hood) lies in
geosynchronous orbit above the planet.

RIKER'S VOICE
... U.S.S. Hood has dropped me
off at Farpoint Station where I
await the arrival of the new
U.S.S. Enterprise...

67 CLOSER - ON THE OLD CITY/STATION (SPEC.FX)

AN AERIAL VIEW of the small, obviously old Bandi city
connected to the modern sprawling spaceport/station,
both set in the middle of a harsh and forbidding
landscape. This is Farpoint Station. CAMERA PUSHES
IN on the Old City portion.

67 CONTINUED:

RIKER'S VOICE
... to which I have been assigned
as first officer. Meanwhile...

68 INT. OLD CITY CORRIDOR - PANNING RIKER

Commander William T. Riker approaching the door leading
to the office at Farpoint's Administrator.

RIKER'S VOICE
... I have been asked to visit
the office of Farpoint Station's
Administrator.

69 INT. ZORN'S OFFICE - OLD CITY - DAY - ANGLE ON RIKER AND ZORN 69

Riker ENTERING, crossing to an elegant, unusually shaped
desk where ZORN, the station Groppler (administrator)
rises and (unused to handshaking) at first offers the
wrong hand, then gets the procedure straightened out
with MUMBLED APOLOGIES. As with all the Bandi, Zorn
is tall, skinny, rather grey-looking -- appears to be
sixtyish (as do all the Bandi, including the young
ones.)

ZORN
I thought you might like to know,
Commander Riker, that we've still
no word from your vessel. But,
I trust we have made your waiting
comfortable?

RIKER
Luxurious is more like it. Would
it seem ungrateful if I ask for
some information?

ZORN
Anything!

RIKER
Fascinating how in the midst of
an old city like this, you've
built a completely modern
tritanium and duraglass space
station. Your energy supply must
be as abundant as I've heard.

69 CONTINUED:

ZORN
Geothermal energy is the one great
blessing of this planet. I'll
have all the details of that sent
to your quarters.

RIKER
Thank you. But it still seems
incredible how you've built this
station so rapidly and so... so
perfectly suited to our needs.

Pushes a desk top bowl of fruit toward Riker.

ZORN
Would your care for an Earth
delicacy, Commander?

RIKER
Well, if there's an apple there...

There isn't and we can SEE that this disappoints Zorn.

RIKER
(looking up; continues)
It doesn't matter... what I was
saying was...
(sees something out of
SCENE)
Well, I'll be damned!

70 CAMERA PANS RIKER

as he steps to the far end of Zorn's desk where ANGLE
REVEALS a second bowl of fruit. Riker picks an apple
from it.

ZORN
Ah... ah yes, there was another
selection here...

RIKER
(perplexed)
Zorn, I would have sworn it wasn't
here a moment ago.

ZORN
And does your failure to notice
it make it unwelcome?
(smiles)
The same with Farpoint Station,
Commander.
(MORE)

70 CONTINUED:

ZORN (Cont'd)
We hope a few easily answered
questions about it won't make
Starfleet appreciate it less.

Riker eyes Zorn thoughtfully, then takes a bite out of
the apple. He chews, then:

RIKER
I'm sure it won't, sir.
(raises apple up)
And this is delicious. Thank you.
(crossing to door)
Good morning, Groppler Zorn.

He is EXITING even as Zorn levers himself out of his
own chair.

ZORN
Good morning.

The door closes behind Riker, and Zorn turns around
angrily.

ZORN
(continuing)
You've been told not to do that.
Why can't you understand? It will
arouse their suspicions.

As he speaks, CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL clearly that
there is no one else in the room, nor does he appear
to be speaking into any sort of communication device.
He seems to be talking to the walls.

ZORN
(continuing)
... and if that happens, we will
have to punish you. We will, I
promise you. We must!

No reply that we can hear. Is this man mad?

CUT TO:

71 INT. FARPOINT FOYER

In considerable contrast to Zorn's old city office we
just left, this structure has a "starbase" look with
its dazzling tritanium and glass construction. The few
people in sight are Starfleet personnel. ENTERING
FOREGROUND are DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER and her
fifteen-year-old son WESLEY.

71 CONTINUED:

Like most other humans of this century, she doesn't look
her age. Although forty years old, she looks hardly
more than thirty. Her attractiveness is underscored
by a naturally provocative walk -- the woman can't help
it. This is counter-balanced by her quick intelligence
and her professional knowledge and skill as a physician.
Her son, Wes, has that same quick intelligence,
multiplied by four. That lively brain is ensconced in
the body of a perfectly normal boy with moderate good
looks, a cheerful personality, but with considerable
maturity for someone his age.

72 ANOTHER ANGLE

Riker ENTERS SCENE behind them and hurries to catch up.
He calls:

RIKER
Doctor Crusher...

WESLEY
Mother, it's Commander Riker.

Beverly slows, lets Riker walk along with them. We see
that despite her attractive face and form, she is
naturally dignified and a bit reserved with new
acquaintances like Riker.

RIKER
And hello to you, Wesley.
Enjoying Farpoint Station?

WESLEY
(happily)
Yes, sir.

Riker smiles at the boy. It's clear he approves of this
polite and likeable kid. Then he becomes aware that
Beverly has not answered his greeting and is waiting.

RIKER
Saw you and thought I'd join your
stroll, if I may.

BEVERLY
Actually, we're about to do some
shopping.

Riker throws her a look. Is she rejecting the offer
of his company?

72 CONTINUED:

RIKER
I've been meaning to visit the
mall myself. If I'm welcome?

BEVERLY
Of course.

She moves toward an exit door. Wes has been looking
from one to the other of them, interested in what
they've said... and not said.

73 INT. FARPOINT SHOPPING MALL - DAY

The ANGLE suggests a covered, airy mall with flowers
and trees -- many of them Earth types but with a
scattering of alien vegetation too. It is a spacious
walkway with a number of pleasant shops and booths.
In b.g. we SEE Bandi natives of this world, a tall and
greyish life form, quiet and overly polite. Beverly,
Wesley and Riker move down a line of shops.

74 CLOSER - BEVERLY, WESLEY, RIKER

as they walk, Wes continuing to eye the two adults.
Then:

WESLEY
If you're wondering about Mom,
Mister Riker, she's isn't actually
unfriendly. She's just shy around
men she doesn't know.

Beverly is startled; Riker amused.

BEVERLY
Wesley... !
(swallows her annoyance;
to Riker)
I believe that means he would like
us to be friends.

RIKER
(grins)
I'm willing, Doctor.
(more serious)
And although we're not officially
part of the Enterprise yet, I
thought there might be something
useful we could do while we wait.

74 CONTINUED:

Beverly stops at a table in front of a shop selling
exotic materials. The modest selections of cloth are
lined up on the table, some draped for best effect.
Beverly looks over them critically, feeling weight and
texture. The Bandi SHOPKEEPER has stayed at the rear
of the booth.

BEVERLY
"Useful"? How and what,
Commander?

RIKER
Investigating some things I've
noticed here, Doctor. The last
was a piece of fruit...

Beverly has frowned over a particularly pretty piece
of material which she holds up for the shopkeeper to
see.

BEVERLY
Would this be available in emerald
green?

The Bandi Merchant smiles, nods and takes the bolt of
cloth INTO A SMALL CLOSED OFF AREA BEHIND. Wes watches
the merchant go as Beverly turns to look at Riker
appraisingly.

BEVERLY
(continuing)
I'm sure, Commander, there are
reasons for a first officer to
want to demonstrate his energy
and alertness to a new captain.
But since my duty and interests
are outside the command
structure...

The Bandi Merchant comes quickly with the bolt of cloth
-- now emerald green -- interrupts Beverly by holding
it up for her approval.

RIKER
Isn't it nice he happened to have
the right color?

Beverly glances sharply at Riker, suppressing a somewhat
chagrined look.

74 CONTINUED: (2)

BEVERLY
(to Merchant)
Thank you. I'll take the entire
bolt. Charge it to Beverly
Crusher, Chief Medical Officer,
USS Enterprise.

The Merchant nods, ticks the information off on a flat
little gadget that dangles from his belt, hands her the
bolt of cloth.

75 ANOTHER ANGLE - DOLLYING WITH BEVERLY, RIKER, WESLEY

as they walk away, Riker enjoying the look that's come
onto her face over this incident.

RIKER
Let's see, where were we?

BEVERLY
I was accusing you of inventing
work in order to curry favor with
your new captain. I apologize.

WESLEY
Finding the exact right color took
him only about twelve seconds,
Mom.

They stop a little distance off and look back toward
the shop.

BEVERLY
Maybe this is something Jean-Luc
Picard will want looked into.

RIKER
Jean-Luc? You know Captain
Picard?

WESLEY
(proudly)
When I was little, he brought my
father's body home to us.

Riker is startled but Beverly only smiles, fondly pats
her son's head.

75 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
Yes, Wes, long, long ago.
(to Riker)
Shall we continue the walk? I'd
like to know you better, Mister
Riker.

CUT TO:

76 INT. FARPOINT LOUNGE - DAY - ON GEORDI AND MARKHAM

LT. GEORDI LaFORGE and ENSIGN SAWYER MARKHAM are in the
small, comfortable lounge area. Markham is a likeable
young man, enthusiastic, energetic. He is still
inclined to shoot from the hip rather than consider
before speaking, but he is a capable (and very new)
graduate of the Academy. We SEE Geordi at first only
from behind, and we may routinely register the fact he
is black.

MARKHAM
Where is she? They say she's
never late -- not since the old
burrhog took over the captain's
chair.

RIKER'S VOICE
You wouldn't be talking about the
Enterprise, would you, Ensign
Markham?

77 WIDER ANGLE

The two young men turn around sharply to find Riker has
come up behind them. The most important thing we notice
about Geordi is that he wears a strange flattish device
(like futuristic goggles) over his eyes. Although he
is technically blind, his head always turns toward the
person speaking to him because he can, in fact, see as
well or better than anyone through the use of the visual
prosthesis. As they realize that Riker is a senior
officer, both young men straighten to attention.

GEORDI/MARKHAM
Sir. Yes, sir.

Riker smiles at the ingrained and traditional response
of the recent Academy graduate.

RIKER
You can stand at ease, gentlemen.
We're not on the Enterprise yet.

77 CONTINUED:

MARKHAM
You know we're assigned to her,
sir.

RIKER
(extending his hand)
Riker. I'm slated to be First
Officer.
(they shake hands)
I read the service records on all
new personnel on the trip out.
Excellent academic record at
Starfleet Academy, Mister Markham.

MARKHAM
Thank you, sir.

RIKER
And you, Mister LaForge. Captain
Dreyer praised your performance
on the Hood. Why did you request
transfer to the Enterprise?

GEORDI
Who wouldn't, sir? The biggest,
newest, fastest starship in the
fleet --

RIKER
Commanded by the best burrhog in
the fleet. Right, Mister Markham?

MARKHAM
(sheepishly)
Yes, sir.

RIKER
(grins)
I've already forgotten who used
those words.

GEORDI
Shouldn't we have heard something
from her by now, sir?

A BANDI WOMAN approaches:

BANDI WOMAN
Commander Riker?

RIKER
Yes?

77 CONTINUED: (2)

BANDI WOMAN
The Enterprise has been picked
up on our monitors, sir. I should
tell you, sir, it is only the
Stardrive Section.

All three crewman are surprised to hear this.

RIKER
(to Woman)
What about the Saucer Module?

BANDI WOMAN
We've received no explanation,
sir. But the captain signals that
you're to beam up immediately.

GEORDI
(to Markham)
Our new captain doesn't waste
time.

RIKER
A good rule for all of us to
follow, gentlemen.

Riker touches his communicator. His VOICE now 'treated'
to indicate he is transmitting. (This will be standard
communicator format.)

RIKER
(continuing)
Enterprise, this is Commander
Riker on Farpoint. Standing by
to beam up.

TRANSPORTER EFFECT (OPTICAL)

FADE OUT.

PART FOUR

FADE IN:

78 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise stardrive module in orbit of the Farpoint
planet.

0 INT. STARDRIVE TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON PLATFORM (OPTICCAL)

As Riker BEAMS IN. Lieutenant Tasha Yar of Security
is there, waiting until Riker is fully materialized,
then:

TASHA
Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir.
Captain Picard will see you on
the Battle Bridge.

Riker was prepared to shake hands but Tasha is already
leading the way toward the turbolift.

80 INT. TURBOLIFT

As Riker follows her inside, she speaks quietly toward
the controls:

TASHA
Battle bridge.

The doors snap closed and the lift moves. Riker looks
Tasha over, waiting, then:

RIKER
With the saucer gone, can I assume
something interesting happened
on your way here?

TASHA
I'll let the captain explain, sir.

81 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD

He is seated in the command chair with Data and
a couple of other crewpersons at their stations.

DATA
We are cleared into the standard
parking orbit, sir.

81 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(nods)
Make it so.

The bridge turbolift doors open, Riker ENTERS the bridge
after Tasha, follows her to Picard.

TASHA
Commander Riker, sir.

RIKER
Riker, W.T., reporting as ordered,
sir.

Picard takes his time, looking Riker over and then
offering his hand.

PICARD
I really didn't expect to welcome
you to half a starship, Riker.
(to Tasha)
Is the viewer ready?

TASHA
All set up, sir.

PICARD
(to Riker)
We'll first bring you up to date
on a little... "adventure" we had
on our way here, Commander. Then
we'll talk.

TASHA
(to Riker)
This way, sir.

True, Picard does not waste time. Tasha is already
leading Riker toward a viewer at the aft section of the
Battle Bridge.

82 ANGLE ON AFT VIEWER

as Tasha motions Riker to the seat, turns the VIEWER
ON. The VIEWER SHOWS A SHOT FROM EARLIER WHEN "Q"
(ELIZABETHAN) HAD APPEARED AND IS TALKING TO Picard.
The VOICES ARE FAINT and Riker leans in, riveting
attention to the bridge record.

83 ANGLE ON PICARD AND DATA

as the android officer turns toward the captain.

83 CONTINUED:

DATA
(interrupting)
Message from the Saucer Module.
It will arrive here in fifty-one
minutes, sir.

PICARD
Inform them we'll hook up as soon
as they arrive.

Picard stands, crosses past Tasha on his way to the
turbolift.

PICARD
(to Tasha)
Bring him to my Ready Room when
he's done there.

Picard EXITS via turbolift.

84 ANGLE ON RIKER

Where VIEWER SHOWS ANGLE ON THE "Q" GRIDWORK STRETCHES
OVER THE HEAVENS, THEN SHOT OF "Q" (21st CENTURY).
Riker TURNS AWAY FROM VIEWER TOWARD CAMERA as he looks
at the crewpersons on the bridge. He speaks to no one
in particular.

RIKER
He calls that "a little
adventure"?

85 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE READY ROOM

Picard at a viewer going over a rather complex screen
of formulas. A KNOCK at the door, he turns the viewer
off.

PICARD
Come.

Riker ENTERS, crosses to where the captain indicates
he's to sit. He does so, looking at Picard. Then:

RIKER
Wow!

PICARD
(laughs, nods)
Exactly.

85 CONTINUED:

RIKER
This "Q", sir... is he crazy?
I mean, seriously?

PICARD
Seriously, does it really matter
how we judge them? We're dealing
with something that can juggle
starships as if they were pebbles.

RIKER
It's a rather astonishing "little
adventure" you've had, Captain.

PICARD
(snaps)
The issue isn't what we call it,
Commander. The important thing
is we can be dead certain...
accent on dead... that "Q" wasn't
joking. We're alive only because
we were placed on "probation",
a very serious kind of
"probation".

Over which we have heard a CHIME SOUND.

PICARD
(continuing)
Go.

DATA'S VOICE
The Saucer Module is now entering
orbit with us, sir.

PICARD
Acknowledged. Commander Riker will
conduct a manual docking. Picard
out.

RIKER
Sir?

PICARD
You've reported in, haven't you?
You are qualified?

RIKER
Yes, sir.

PICARD
Then I meant now, Mister Riker.

Riker jumps to his feet, EXITS. CAMERA PANS to Picard
whose expression now relaxes. He's not too unhappy with
what he's seen of his new first officer so far.

86 EXT. SPACE - SAUCER SECTION, BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL)

As before, the Saucer Section is above and ahead of the
battle section. The battle section is SLOWLY moving
ahead toward the Saucer Section for link-up.

87 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - FULL SHOT

Riker at the conn, concentrating. Tasha and Data are
studying him, privately evaluating this new man.

DATA
You say you will be doing this
manually, sir? No automation?

RIKER
As ordered.

88 EMPHASIZING RIKER

He's making a couple of calculations, glancing up at
the viewscreen.

89 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

The rear end of the saucer is moving closer, but it is
still high.

90 EMPHASIZING RIKER

RIKER
(to Data at Conn)
Two percent rise. Up angle
adjustment three degrees.
Maintain docking speed.

Ops and conn positions AD LIB repeats of Riker's orders.

91 EXT. SPACE - SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL)

The battle section is seen rising, angling forward
slightly, still moving slowly toward the saucer.

92 INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING RIKER

glancing at the O.S. viewscreen, works his console
again.

RIKER
Level her out. Maintain docking
speed. Docking crew, prepare for
reconnection.

93 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL)

The two are level now, quite close together, the battle
section still moving slowly forward.

94 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER

Riker looks up at the viewscreen again.

95 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

The saucer looms in the viewscreen -- everything is
level, the docking section is dead ahead -- we are still
moving forward.

96 CLOSE ON RIKER

He makes a couple of quick entries on his console.

RIKER
All stop. Her inertia should do
the job now.

97 EXT. SPACE - SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL)

The two glide together smoothly.

98 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE SHOT

Riker hits a couple more tabs on his panel as:

RIKER
Rejoin lock-up... now.

99 EXT. SPACE - FINAL HOOK-UP (OPTICAL)

The reverse of disconnecting SHOTS we saw earlier --
huge STARDRIVE SECTION and SAUCER MODULE MECHANISMS
MAKING FINAL HOOK-UP.

100 EXT. ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)

The docking complete.

101 INT. TURBOLIFT

Riker with Data, Tasha, and others. The time this takes
is indicative of the size of this new Enterprise.

101 CONTINUED:

RIKER (V.O.)
Enterprise log, First Officer
entry. Ship's modules rejoined,
stardate 42354.71 with command
now transferred back to the main
bridge.

Riker looks up to see Tasha is watching him. Then:

TASHA
Neatly done, sir.

RIKER
I don't imagine many mistakes
happen under Captain Picard.

TASHA
No sir, they don't.

102 INT. BRIDGE

As the turbolift arrives. Lt. Worf crosses toward it,
intercepts Riker.

WORF
I'm Lieutenant Worf, sir. Captain
Picard requests you come
immediately to his quarters.

Having had little more than a glance at this main
bridge, Riker turns and re-enters the turbolift.

103 INT. PICARD'S CABIN

Much larger and more comfortable than the small battle
Ready Room we were in earlier. Picard is there, turning
as he hears a KNOCK:

PICARD
Come!

Riker ENTERS.

PICARD
(continuing)
A fairly routine maneuver but you
handled it quite well.

RIKER
Thank you, sir. I hope I show
some promise.

103 CONTINUED:

An exchange of looks between the two. Clearly, Riker
is annoyed by this "faint praise" kind of welcome.
Picard leads the way to a setting for coffee.

PICARD
Some coffee.

RIKER
No thank you, sir.

PICARD
(pours himself a cup)
And now I have a kind of "what
sort of second-in-command have
I inherited?" question.

RIKER
Yes sir, I thought you might.

There's nothing disrespectful in Riker's tone of voice,
but he does leave an impression that he's not to be
walked on either.

PICARD
I noticed in your envelope that
Captain DeSoto thinks very highly
of you. One curious thing,
however, you refused to let him
beam down to Altair IV?

RIKER
In my opinion, sir, Altair IV was
too dangerous to risk exposing
the captain.

PICARD
I see. A captain's rank means
nothing to you.

RIKER
Rather the reverse, sir. A
captain's life means a great deal
to me.

PICARD
Let me postulate something here,
Mister Riker. Isn't it just possible
that you don't get to be a
starship captain without knowing
when it's safe to beam down or
not? Isn't it a little
presumptuous for a first officer
to second guess his captain's
judgment?

103 CONTINUED: (2)

RIKER
Permission to speak candidly, sir?

PICARD
Always.

RIKER
You've been a first officer
yourself. You know that assuming
that responsibility must, by
definition, include the safety
of the captain. I have no problem
with following the rules you lay
down. But under no circumstances
will I compromise your safety.
If you have a problem with that,
sir, you can put me back on the
Hood before she leaves.

PICARD
You don't intend to back off that
position?

RIKER
No, sir, I can't.

Picard takes another beat to study him carefully, then:

PICARD
One further thing... a special
favor I have to ask of you.

RIKER
Anything, sir.

PICARD
Using the same kind of strength
you showed with Captain DeSoto,
I'd appreciate it if you can keep
me from making an ass of myself
with children.

RIKER
Sir?

PICARD
I'm not a family man, Riker, and
yet, Starfleet has given me a ship
with children aboard.

RIKER
(nods)
Yes, sir. And families...

103 CONTINUED: (3)

PICARD
And I don't feel comfortable with
children. But, since a captain
needs an image of "geniality"
toward the little monsters, you're
to see that's exactly what I
project.

RIKER
Aye, sir.

For the first time, Picard smiles, extending his hand.
We see he's surprisingly warm when he wants to be.
Riker takes Picard's hand for a firm and friendly
handshake.

PICARD
Welcome to the Enterprise, Mister
Riker.

104 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE

as Riker steps out of the turbolift. He stops, takes
in the size of his compared to the Battle Bridge. The
Klingon Lieutenant is at the conn position. He turns,
seeing Riker:

WORF
Yes sir, Commander?

Riker crosses in, shakes hands.

RIKER
Thank you, Lieutenant. Is
Commander Data on duty?

WORF
Commander Data is on a special
assignment, sir. He's using our
shuttlecraft to transfer an
admiral over to the Hood.

RIKER
An admiral?

WORF
He's been aboard all day, sir,
checking over medical layout.

RIKER
Why the shuttlecraft? Can he just
beam over?

104 CONTINUED:

WORF
I suppose he could, sir. But the
admiral's a rather remarkable man.

105 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - ANGLE AT INTERSECTION

DATA'S VOICE
But, sir, the transporter could
have you on the Hood in a matter
of seconds, Admiral.

Data and the admiral ENTER SCENE at the intersection.
The admiral is very old with an almost transparent look.

ADMIRAL
Have you got some reason to want
my atoms scattered all over space?

DATA
No sir. But at your age, sir,
I thought you shouldn't have to
put up with the time and trouble
of a shuttlecraft.

The admiral stops. Facing Data, he draws himself. up
as straight as he can. His voice is crotchety and
trembly -- and fiercely stubborn.

ADMIRAL
My age? Hold it right there, boy,
what about my age?

DATA
Sorry, sir. If that subject
troubles you...

ADMIRAL
Troubles me? What's so damned
troubling about not having died?
How old do you think I am?

DATA
One hundred forty-seven years,
Admiral. According to Starfleet
records.

ADMIRAL
Explain how you remember that so
exactly.

DATA
I remember every fact I am exposed
to, sir.

105 CONTINUED:

The admiral peers at him closely, scowling.

ADMIRAL
I don't see any points on your
ears, boy, but you sound like a
Vulcan.

DATA
No, sir. I am an android.

ADMIRAL
(snorts)
Almost as bad.

DATA
(at a loss, but still
respectful)
I thought it was generally
accepted, sir, that Vulcans are
an advanced and most honorable
race.

The admiral stares at him a moment, his severe blue eyes
gentling and his feisty scowl fading. He pats Data's
sleeve and nods slightly.

ADMIRAL
They are, boy. They are. And
also damned annoying at times.

DATA
Yes, sir.

As they move away, Data gently assisting the old man:

ADMIRAL
This is a new ship, boy, but she's
got the right name. Remember
that.

DATA
I will, sir.

ADMIRAL
You treat her like a lady.
(beat, quietly)
She'll always bring you home...
FADE OUT.

PART FIVE

FADE IN:

106 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

Both the Enterprise and the Hood in orbit close
together. CAMERA ANGLE shows how much LARGER the
Enterprise is.

107 INT. SICKBAY

Beverly is wearing medical "blue" -- or whatever color
Science personnel are going to be assigned. She steps
toward a LARGE VIEWSCREEN which comes on, showing
readouts indicative of the status of the ship's medical
facilities.

BEVERLY
Show me the results of Captain
Picard's most recent physical
examination.

The screen promptly BEGINS TO FLASH UP PRINTED
INFORMATION, followed by X-Ray type shots, etc. Beverly
studies it for awhile.

PICARD'S VOICE
Already at work, Doctor?

108 ANOTHER ANGLE

As Beverly turns to find Captain Picard ENTERING. She
nods in answer to his question.

BEVERLY
Yes, on a subject that's very
important to this mission,
Captain.
(unhurriedly to
computer)
Screen off.

The screen GOES DARK.

PICARD
I wanted to say "welcome aboard."

109 CLOSER ANGLE - BEVERLY AND PICARD

As if they're appraising each other, then:

109 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
Thank you, Captain.

PICARD
And I thought I should talk to
you very personally about your
assignment here.

110 CLOSER TWO SHOT

As Beverly nods, waits for him to continue.

PICARD
(continuing)
I wanted you to know I protested
your posting to the Enterprise.

BEVERLY
Oh? Do you consider me
unqualified?

PICARD
Hardly. Your service record shows
you exactly the kind of CMO I'd
want.

BEVERLY
Then you must object to me
personally. Has it to do with
our last meeting?

PICARD
I'm trying to be considerate of
your feelings, Doctor Crusher.
For you to serve with a commanding
officer who would continually
remind you of such a terrible
personal tragedy...

BEVERLY
(annoyed; snaps)
If I had any objections to serving
with you, I wouldn't have
requested this assignment,
Captain.

PICARD
You requested this posting?

He turns to exit. Beverly stirs, and her next words
stop him.

110 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
Captain. My feelings about my
husband's death will have no
effect on the way I serve you,
this vessel, or this mission.

Picard gives it a moment's thought, extends his hand.

PICARD
Then, welcome aboard, Doctor.
I'm pleased to have you here.

Beverly allows only a perfunctory handshake.

BEVERLY
Thank you. And now, if I can
return to my duties...

It is clear that Picard wanted to say more but she has
neatly blocked any further conversation.

PICARD
(uncomfortably)
Well... as I said, "welcome
Aboard".

She doesn't respond further and he has no choice but
to turn and exit.

111 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND HOOD IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)

Again, EMPHASIZING the considerable difference in the
sizes of the two starships as we SEE that the USS Hood
is PULLING AWAY, LEAVING ORBIT.

112 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER

He is standing before the huge viewscreen. Behind him
is the young Klingon, Worf, at the conn position with
the rest of the bridge stations only nominally manned.
Set in geosynchronous orbit over the planet, the
Enterprise requires minimal monitoring at this time.

113 ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT DOORS

They OPEN, and Picard steps out onto the bridge.

PICARD
Have you signaled the Hood, Mister
Riker?

113 CONTINUED:

RIKER
(nods)
Your exact message.
(in French)
Bon voyage mon amie. Aye, sir.

114 ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER

as Picard smiles and steps toward it.

PICARD
And what was my answer, computer?

MAIN VIEWER FLICKERS, then startles us with an ugly
FLASH OF LIGHT that becomes an IMAGE OF "Q" (JUDGE)
who is in LIMBO, but looking directly at Picard. His
VOICE BOOMS LOUDLY, annoyed in tone:

"Q" (JUDGE)
DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT PATIENTLY
THROUGH ALL THIS NONSENSE? OR
DID YOU THINK I WAS GONE?

Picard is as startled as Riker. The young Klingon,
Worf, comes tumbling out of the conn position, drawing
his phaser and placing himself protectively between
Picard and the threatening "Q" image.

PICARD
Do you intend to blast a hole
through the viewer, Lieutenant?

Worf apologetically puts his phaser away, lets Picard
wave him aside.

PICARD
(continuing)
If the purpose of this is to test
human worth, your honor, you must
let us proceed in a normal human
way.

"Q" (JUDGE)
YOU ARE DILATORY! YOU HAVE
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS! ANY FURTHER
DELAY AND YOU RISK SUMMARY
JUDGEMENT AGAINST YOU, CAPTAIN.

A FLASH OF LIGHT and the main viewer returns to an image
of the planet below.

115 ANOTHER ANGLE

WORF
Sorry, sir...

RIKER
No criticism. You reacted fast...

PICARD
... but in a completely useless
way.

WORF
I'll learn to do better, sir.

PICARD
Of course you will. We've a long
voyage ahead of us.

Picard dismisses Worf with a flicker of a smile which
takes the sting out of what he just said.

RIKER
(lowers voice)
Hope you're right, sir. About
the long voyage ahead.

Picard looks to main viewer as if checking that "Q" is
truly gone.

PICARD
I hope so too.

RIKER
What do we do, sir? With them
monitoring every move, every
word...

PICARD
S.O.P., Mister Riker.

RIKER
Standard Operating Procedures?

PICARD
(nods)
We do exactly what we'd do if this
"Q" never existed. If we're going
to be damned, let's be damned for
what we really are.

Riker is suddenly very pleased with this captain. He
nods emphatically.

FADE OUT.

PART SIX

FADE IN:

116 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

U.S.S. Enterprise in orbit of planet Cygnus IV.

PICARD V.O.
Captain's log, stardate 42372.5.
Of the twenty-four hours "Q"
allotted us to prove ourselves...

117 INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER

Minimum bridge crew on duty.

PICARD V.O.
... eleven have now passed without
incident. And yet I cannot forget
"Q's" prediction that we will face
here some critical test of human
worth.

118 INT. BRIDGE READY ROOM

Picard and Riker comparing notes.

RIKER
This planet's interior heat
results in abundant geothermal
energy, sir. But it's about all
this world does offer.

PICARD
And it's your belief that this
is what made it possible for them
to construct this base to
Starfleet standards?

RIKER
Yes sir. We have to assume that
they've been trading their surplus
energy for the construction
materials used here. According
to our ship's scans, many of the
materials used are not found on
this world.

118 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(smiles)
Perhaps it's like those incidents
you describe in your report as
"almost magical" attempts to
please us.

RIKER
Those events did happen, sir.

PICARD
And in time we'll discover the
explanation. Meanwhile, none of
it suggests anything threatening.
If only every life form had as
much desire to please Starfleet.
(stands)
Ready to beam down? I'm looking
forward to meeting this Groppler
Zorn.

Picard is leading Riker to the cabin door.

RIKER
I'm convinced there's more to it
than just "pleasing us", sir.

PICARD
(as they exit)
Like something "Q" is doing to
trick us?

119 INT. BRIDGE

As Picard and Riker enter from the adjoining Ready Room.
Troi is just arriving in the turbolift and Picard calls
to her.

PICARD
Over here, Counselor!
(to Riker)
I've asked her to join us in this
meeting.
(indicating)
May I introduce our new first
officer, Commander William Riker.
Mister Riker, our ship's
counselor, Deanna Troi.

120 TWO SHOT - RIKER AND TROI

He's obviously stunned to find her here, although she
isn't at all surprised.

TROI'S VOICE
(carrying her thoughts)
Do you remember what I taught you,
Imzadi? Can you still sense my
thoughts?

Then, she holds out her hand formally.

TROI
A pleasure, Commander.

RIKER
(nervously)
I, ah... likewise, Counselor.

121 ANGLE INCLUDING PICARD

Studying the two of them with some curiosity now.

PICARD
(to Riker)
Have the two of you met before?

RIKER
We... we have, sir.

PICARD
Excellent. I consider it
important that my key officers
know each other's abilities.

TROI
We do, sir; we do.

Meanwhile, Picard has indicated the turbolift and is
leading them toward it.

122 EMPHASIZING TROI

As she looks back toward Riker serenely.

TROI'S VOICE
(her thoughts)
I, too, would never say goodbye,
Imzadi.

123 EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL)

ESTABLISHING SHOT as:

PICARD'S VOICE
My crew and I need a bit more
information...

124 INT. ZORN'S OFFICE

Where Zorn sits behind his desk, his posture and
attitude indicating some nervousness. Seated facing
him are Picard, Riker, and Troi. We see that Zorn's
attention is on Troi.

PICARD
(continuing)
... before we make our
recommendations to Starfleet.

ZORN
No objections to that, but...
(eyeing Troi again)
... but I'm puzzled over your
bringing a Betazoid to this. If
her purpose here is to probe my
thoughts, sir...

TROI
I can sense only strong emotions,
Groppler. I am only half Betazoid;
my father was a Starfleet officer.

ZORN
I have nothing to hide, of course.

PICARD
Good, since we admire what we've
seen of your construction
techniques. Starfleet may be
interested in your constructing
starbases elsewhere too.

125 ANGLE EMPHASIZING TROI

As her expression begins to indicate an awareness of
something distressing, something painful. During which:

ZORN
Unfortunately, Captain, we are
not interested in building other
facilities.

126 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER

This stumps Picard for a moment, during which:

RIKER
If I may, Captain...
(gets a nod)
Then a trade, Groppler? Some
things you need in return for the
loan of architects and engineers
who can demonstrate your
techniques.

127 EMPHASIZING ZORN

ZORN
We Bandi do not wish to leave our
home world. If Starfleet cannot
accept that small weakness, then
we will be forced, unhappily, to
seek an alliance with someone like
the Ferengi, or...

Zorn interrupted by a small GROAN coming from Troi.
Her eyes are now closed over a strong distress she's
sensing.

128 VARIOUS OTHER ANGLES

As appropriate.

PICARD
Counselor... ? What is it?

TROI
(glancing toward Zorn)
Do you want it described here,
sir?

PICARD
Yes! No secrets here if we're
all to be friends.
(to Zorn)
Agreed, Groppler?

ZORN
We ourselves have nothing to hide,
but...

128 CONTINUED:

TROI
(another GROAN,
grimacing)
Pain... pain, loneliness, terrible
loneliness, despair...
(indicates Zorn)
I'm not sensing him, sir. Or any
of his people... but it's
something very close to this location.

PICARD
(to Zorn, demandingly)
The source of this? Do you have
any idea?

ZORN
No!
(stands)
No, absolutely not. And I find
nothing helpful or productive in
any of this!

PICARD
(stands, to Zorn)
That's it? No other comment?

ZORN
What do you expect form us? We
offer a base designed to your
needs, luxurious even by human
standards...

Riker and Troi come to their feet too as Picard
interrupts.

PICARD
... while refusing to answer even
our simplest questions about it.
(to Riker)
We'll adjourn for now...
(to Zorn)
... while we all reconsider our
positions.

The three CROSS toward the exit.

ZORN
Captain, the Ferengi would be very
interested in a base like this.

PICARD
Fine. I hope they find you as
tasty as their other past
associates.

Picard and his people EXIT.

129 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

The U.S.S. Enterprise still in orbit over Cygnus IV.

130 INT. HOLODECK CORRIDOR

Riker moving as if seeking someone. He intercepts a
YOUNG ENSIGN who is passing and the junior officer sees
Riker's emblem of rank and snaps to attention.

RIKER
Ensign, can you help me find
Commander Data? I was told he's
somewhere on this deck.

YOUNG ENSIGN
This way, sir.

131 ANGLE AT CORRIDOR WALL

As the Ensign steps to a black surface of the corridor
wall.

YOUNG ENSIGN
You must be new to these galaxy
class starships, sir.
(puts hand on the black
surface, saying)
Tell me the location of Commander
Data.

At the touch and the words "Tell me" the black surface
comes alive with light patterns showing appropriate
information.

COMPUTER VOICE
Lieutenant Commander Data... now
located in Holodeck area 4-J.

YOUNG ENSIGN
(indicating readout)
And as you see, sir, it's pointing
you that way.

RIKER
Go that way? How far?

YOUNG ENSIGN
(smiles)
You'll know, sir.

Riker AD LIBS a thanks, goes in the indicated direction.

132 PANNING RIKER

Moving off in the indicated direction. Then the black
surface there comes alive with a FLASHING DIRECTION
SIGNAL.

COMPUTER VOICE
This way, please. The next
hatchway on your right.

RIKER
(responding
automatically)
Thank you...

COMPUTER VOICE
You're more than welcome,
Commander Riker.

Which startles him a bit but he walks on and turns right
at a sophisticated looking Holodeck Hatchway.

133 EXT. PARKLAND

The Parkland hidden at this moment by a WILD SECTION
OF CORRIDOR WALL AND HATCHWAY which, when the hatch is
opened, will REVEAL PARKLAND.

COMPUTER VOICE
(continuing without
delay)
And if you care to enter,
Commander...

RIKER
(snaps; interrupting)
I do.

Immediately, the hatch slides open and we SEE THE
PARKLAND (LOCATION). It looks (and is) real, including
land contours, trees, and even a small stream nearby.
Beyond that the Parkland stretches off for what appears
to be miles and miles away to the horizon.

134 ANGLE BACK TOWARD HATCHWAY

As Riker ENTERS through it and stands inspecting the
Parkland scene with genuine appreciation and then HEARS
SOMEONE WHISTLING A MELODY, but doing it rather badly
and laboriously.

135 ANGLE PAST RIKER INTO PARKLAND

As he MOVES AWAY, seeking the source of the WHISTLING
which will begin to grow LOUDER now.

136 ANGLE AT STREAM

As Riker crosses, stepping from rock to rock. He makes
a misstep, almost falls, then recovers and gets across.
He looks back at the stone which caused it.

137 CLOSER ON RIKER

As he walks, the WHISTLING is nearby now. He stops,
calls:

RIKER
Hello!

The WHISTLING has continued without pause, Riker cocks
his ear, corrects his direction slightly.

138 EXT. WOODLAND GLEN

Riker ENTERS SHOT through shrubbery, sees something and
stops.

139 ANGLE ON DATA

Lying there, cushioned by deep grass. He's totally
absorbed in certain melody notes he's attempting -- and
keeps missing.

140 PANNING RIKER

Moving onto TWO SHOT where he stops, and WHISTLES the
same melody, hitting the correct notes. A startled Data
looks up blankly, then comes quickly to his feet, but
Riker waves him back down, sits beside him.

DATA
Marvelous how easily humans do
that, sir. I still need much
practice.

Riker, acting uncomfortable, avoids the subject. He
hesitates, then:

RIKER
There are some puzzles down on
the planet that Captain Picard
wants answered. He suggests I
put you on the away team I'll be
using.

140 CONTINUED:

DATA
I shall endeavor to give
satisfaction, sir.

Riker hesitates, wanting to say something but not sure
how to begin.

RIKER
Uh, yes. And when the captain
suggested you I, uh, looked up
your record...
(hesitates)

DATA
Yes sir, a wise procedure always.

RIKER
Your rank of lieutenant commander,
I assume now must be honorary.

DATA
No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78;
honors in quantum mathematics
and exobiology.

RIKER
But your files... they say you're
a...

DATA
(waits, then)
Machine? Correct, sir. Does that
trouble you?

RIKER
(hesitates)
To be honest... yes, a little.

DATA
Understood, sir. Prejudice is
very human.

RIKER
Now that troubles me. Do you
consider yourself superior to us?

DATA
I am superior in many ways. But
I would gladly give it up to be
human.

RIKER
(studies Data, then)
Nice to meet you, Pinocchio,

140 CONTINUED: (2)

Data seems confused by this.

RIKER
(continuing; explains)
A joke.

DATA
(straight-faced)
Ah! Intriguing.

RIKER
(big grin)
You're going to be an interesting
companion, Mister Data.

FADE OUT.

PART SEVEN

FADE IN:

141 EXT. PARKLAND - RIKER AND DATA

We HEAR A VOICE (Wesley) and Riker gets to his feet,
looks off in that direction.

DATA
This pattern is quite popular,
sir. Perhaps because it
duplicates Earth so well, Coming
here,
(apologetically)
makes me feel as if I'm human too.

RIKER
(taking it all in)
I didn't believe these could be
so real.

DATA
Much of it is real, sir. If the
transporters can convert our
bodies to an energy beam, then
back to the original pattern
again...

RIKER
Yes, of course.
(indicates)
And all these have much simpler
patterns.

142 EXT. PARKLAND AT STREAM

Data leading the way, then indicates.

DATA
The rear wall.

RIKER
(peers)
I can't see it.

DATA
You will.

PANNING RIKER TOWARD US

He's squinting hard now. Then he stops, reacts at
something he can now make out.

RIKER
Incredible!

143 INT. STAGE HOLODECK - ANGLE PAST RIKER (OPTICAL)

As he hurries toward where we can now SEE the holodeck
wall (REAR PROJECTION SCREEN) on which we can now SEE
that the PARKLAND soil, rocks and vegetation blend with
the PROJECTED IMAGE there. Astonished, Riker backs away
from this, squinting again.

144 EXT. REAL PARKLAND - RIKER'S P.O.V.

Where, of course, the wall blend is no longer visible.

WESLEY'S VOICE
(calling)
Mister Riker, isn't this great?

MEDIUM ON RIKER

Turning, then grinning, waving.

RIKER'S P.O.V. - THE ROCK CROSSING AT STREAM

Where Wes Crusher is hurrying toward us, bouncing from
rock to rock.

WESLEY
This is one of the simpler
patterns, Mister Riker. They've
got thousands more, some you just
can't believe.

ANGLE TO INCLUDE RIKER AND DATA

Moving down the stream.

RIKER
Careful, that next rock is
loose... !

WIDER ANGLE

As that rock moves underfoot, tumbling Wes into the
stream.

PANNING DATA IN, demonstrating his enormous strength
as he easily lifts Wesley completely out of the water.
An amazed Wesley looks at Data.

WESLEY
Wow!

145 EXT. PARKLAND - ANGLE ON WILD HATCHWAY AND CORRIDOR SECTION

As the hatchway smoothly SLIDES OPEN AGAIN. Through
it is REVEALED THE PARKLAND, through which Riker, Data
and a very wet Wesley make their way to the HATCHWAY.
As they MOVE THROUGH HATCHWAY, the bulkhead BEGINS
CLOSING.

146 INT. HOLODECK CORRIDOR - ANGLE ON CAPTAIN PICARD

The Captain walking with a Senior Officer when he sees
Riker and the others. He motions the Senior Officer
to continue on by himself, stops and waits.

VARIOUS ANGLES - AS APPROPRIATE

As Riker, Data and Wes move INTO SHOT with Picard. Wes
is instantly aware that his soaked clothing is dripping
water onto the starship deck. He'd like to remove
himself but knows that Picard has already seen his
puddle forming on the deck.

RIKER
Mister Data has agreed to join
my away team, Captain.

PICARD
(with another glance
toward Wes's puddle)
Very good.

WES
Sir, maybe I should get something
to wipe this water up.

PICARD
(coolly)
Good idea.

Picard turns and EXITS.

147 INT. SICKBAY - BEVERLY AND WESLEY

Wesley is wiping himself dry now. He is
enthusiastically trying to explain his adventures.

WESLEY
-- and there's a low gravity
gymnasium, too. It would be hard
to get bored on this ship.

148 CLOSER TWO SHOT - BEVERLY AND WESLEY

As he wipes, he's been turning something over in his
mind.

WESLEY
Mom...
(beat)
could you get me a look at the
bridge?

BEVERLY
That's against the captain's
standing orders.

WESLEY
Are you afraid of the captain,
too?

BEVERLY
I certainly am not!

WESLEY
But Captain Picard is a pain,
isn't he?

BEVERLY
Your father liked him very much.
Great explorers are often lonely,
... no chance to have a family...

WESLEY
Just a look, at the bridge, Mom.
From the turbolift when the doors
open. I wouldn't get off. I
promise.

BEVERLY
You're looking for trouble, Wes.

He shuts up. Beverly looks at him and can't ignore the
very real want in his eyes.

BEVERLY
(continuing)
Let's see what we can do.

On Wes's delighted grin:

CUT TO:

149 EXT. FARPOINT STATION/CITY - DAY - EMPHASIZING STATION

TO ESTABLISH our location.

150 INT. STATION SHOPPING AREA - DAY - ON AWAY TEAM

Which is made up of Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha and Geordi.
There are a number of people in the mall area, some in
identifiable Enterprise-type uniforms. The others are
in various civilian clothes. They are taking in the
Bandi shops, booths, food and drink offered by Bandi
vendors.

TASHA
Recommend that someone could begin
by examining the underside of the
station, sir.

TROI
Our sensors do show some passages
down there, sir. Perhaps you and
I?

Troi glances at Riker with just a shade of archness,
perhaps the lift of an eyebrow. Riker glances away,
troubled.

RIKER
Tasha, you and the Counselor.

Troi and Tasha move off. Riker turns to Geordi.

RIKER
Let's us start with the topside.
Have you noticed anything unusual?

Riker and the others move out of scene, examining
everything they pass.

DISSOLVE TO:

151 INT. ANOTHER STATION AREA

ON GEORDI as he looks around the area, moving slowly
and carefully scanning. Then he shakes his head.

GEORDI
Well, I can't see through solid
matter, sir, but the material so
far looks very ordinary.

DATA
Confirmed by the construction
records, sir. Almost exactly the
same material that Starfleet uses.

Riker reaches to his insignia, to switch on his
communicator.

151 CONTINUED:

RIKER
Riker to Tasha, Troi, come in!

We milk the next few moments, Riker growing
apprehensive. Then, finally, with Riker showing relief:

TASHA'S VOICE
(from communicator)
We were about to call you, Team
Leader. We've found something
interesting.

152 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

Not at all what one would expect of a "service tunnel",
if this is indeed that. These are smooth, rounded,
glistening walls whose GLOW lights up the entire
passageway. (We'll see something similar later on a
mystery vessel). Tasha is activating her communicator.

TASHA
We're in a passageway directly
under the station sir. But the
tunnel walls here are make from
something we've never seen before.

RIKER'S VOICE
And Troi, have you sensed anything
there?

Troi appears reluctant as she activates her
communicator.

TROI
Sir, I've avoided opening my mind.
Whatever I sensed in the
Groppler's office became very
painful.

RIKER
I'm sorry, Counselor, but you
must. We need more information.

Troi complies... then her face contorts in agony and
a SMALL SCREAM ESCAPES. She sinks to her knees, Tasha
hurrying in to support her.

TROI
(continuing)
No, no, such pain. It's so close to
us here... pain, pain..

152 CONTINUED:

RIKER'S VOICE
(overlapping)
Hang on, I'm coming... Enterprise,
lock us onto her signal!

Tasha has her arm around Troi, whispering words of
comfort.

153 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

After a moment, the familiar TRANSPORTER SOUND BEGINS.
Riker, Data, and Geordi BEAM IN, SOLIDIFY. Then Riker
hurries over to Troi while Data and Geordi examine their
surroundings with great curiosity.

154 ANGLE ON TROI

Riker helping her very tenderly:

RIKER
I'm sorry. Close your mind from
the pain...

TROI
It's also unhappiness... terrible
despair...

RIKER
Who?

TROI
I don't know! No lifeform anything
like us.

Riker is looking around at the glowing walls.

RIKER
What in the hell kind of place
is this?
(turning)
Geordi, what do you see?

Geordi has been inspecting the wall closely. He shakes
his head.

GEORDI
It's of no material I recognize,
sir. Or have even heard of.

155 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

As before, in geosynchronous orbit.

156 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD

in the captain's chair. The bridge is nominally manned
at this time. We will see Worf at the ops panel.
Picard glances around as the SOUND OF THE TURBOLIFT
DOORS OPENING COMES OVER, and he freezes.

157 PICARD'S P.O.V. - BEVERLY AND WESLEY

standing just inside the turbolift door. Beverly is
uncomfortable; Wes is all eyes, taking in as much as
he possibly can in this one limited look at his dream
place. Beverly starts to step out, gesturing to Wes
to stay in the turbolift.

BEVERLY
Permission to report to the
captain...

158 WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING PICARD, BEVERLY

PICARD
(coolly)
Children are not allowed on the
bridge, Doctor.

BEVERLY
Captain, my son is not on the
bridge. He merely accompanied
me on the turbolift.

PICARD
Your son?

BEVERLY
His name's Wesley. You last saw
him years ago when...

She trails her words; Picard understands.

PICARD
Oh, back then.

He glances from Beverly to Wesley, clears his throat.

PICARD
(continuing)
Well -- as long as he's here...

159 WIDER - INCLUDING WESLEY, BEVERLY, PICARD

Wesley looks to Picard hopefully. Beverly waits, then
Picard shrugs, tries to sound friendly.

159 CONTINUED:

PICARD
I knew your father, Wesley. Want
a look around?

Wesley is out like a shot.

PICARD
(continuing; quickly)
But don't touch anything!

Wes is in awe. To him, this is the equivalent of a
devout Catholic stepping into the nave of St. Peter's
Basilica. The turbolift is on the level of the
"horseshoe", so the command positions are spread below
him. Picard moves down to the captain's chair level,
Wes moving with him. He is careful to put his feet down
just right so he doesn't even scuff the floor. Picard
watches, steps aside to gesture toward the command
chair.

PICARD
(continuing)
Try it out.
(as Wes does so)
The panel on your right is for
log entries, library-computer
access and retrieval, viewscreen
control, intercoms, and so on.

WESLEY
(nodding; pointing)
Yes sir. And here, the backup conn
and ops panels, plus armament and
shield controls.

Picard looks closely at Wes, perplexed.

PICARD
The forward viewscreen is
controlled by the ops position...

WESLEY
Yes sir, which uses high
resolution, multi-spectral imaging
sensor systems...

PICARD
How the hell do you know that,
boy?

Before Beverly or Wes can reply, a VERY DISTINCTIVE
SIGNAL SOUNDS (Captain's comm signal) and Wes, closest
to the control, transfers the signal into audio as:

159 CONTINUED: (2)

WES
Perimeter alert, Captain!

Wesley is instantly embarrassed; Beverly is mortified;
Picard is ang7ry.

WES BEVERLY
I'm sorry. I didn't mean Wes! You shouldn't
to... have touched anything...

PICARD
Off the bridge! Both of you.

Worf has come to his feet, not sure whether or not he
should respond to the call. Beverly is hustling Wesley
toward the turbolift.

WORF
You have a perimeter alert,
Captain.

BEVERLY
(to Picard)
As my son tried to tell you!

She EXITS into the turbolift, the doors CLOSING behind
her and Wesley. Picard, slamming his fist into his
other palm, jumps for his command chair as:

PICARD
Picard. Go ahead.

SECURITY VOICE
Ship's sensors have detected the
presence of a vessel approaching
this planet. No ship is scheduled
to arrive at this time.

PICARD
Have Mister Riker, and his team
beamed back up! Security, could
that be the Hood returning here?

SECURITY VOICE
The vessel does not match the
Hood's configuration or I.D.
signal.

PICARD
Put it on main viewer!

160 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

Instantly, the image of a ship is flashed on the screen.
It appears big, dark, ominous -- even at far range --
and it is approaching very swiftly.

161 ANGLE ON PICARD AND WORF

PICARD
Identification?

SECURITY VOICE
Vessel unknown, configuration
unknown, sir.

PICARD
Hail it!

WORF
(works his panel)
We've been trying, sir. No
response.

PICARD
Raise all shields, phasers at
ready.

WORF
(works panel)
Shields up, sir. Phasers ready.
(turns to Picard)
Could this be that "Q" you
mentioned, sir?

162 CLOSE ON PICARD

staring at the viewscreen.

PICARD
I almost hope so, Lieutenant.
We face too many "unknowns"
already.

163 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

The ship is closer now -- looks menacing -- and still
coming fast.

FADE OUT.

PART EIGHT

FADE IN:

164 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise in orbit.

165 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

All bridge positions are filled now, everyone watching
the viewscreen intently.

166 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

The mystery vessel approaching closer.

167 PICARD AND WORF

PICARD
Continue universal greeting on
all frequencies. Get me Groppler
Zorn.

There is a BEEP, a pause, then:

ZORN'S VOICE
This is Zorn, Captain.

168 INT. ZORN'S OFFICE - DAY - ON ZORN

He is seated at the desk, speaks into a small portable
communicator grid shaped to fit the palm of his hand.

PICARD'S VOICE
There is an unidentified vessel
moving into orbit with us. Do you
know who it is?

169 INTERCUT BETWEEN ZORN AND PICARD AS NEEDED.

ZORN
There are no ships scheduled to
arrive until --

PICARD
I asked if you know who it is,
Groppler. You mentioned the
Ferengi Alliance to me.

169 CONTINUED:

ZORN
(very nervous)
But we have had no dealings with
them. It was only a... a
thought.

PICARD
Are you very, very certain of
that, Groppler?

ZORN
I promise you we were making an
empty threat, Captain. I wanted
your cooperation. Forgive me --

WORF
Definitely entering an orbital
trajectory, sir.

SECURITY POSITION
It measures half again our size,
Captain.

170 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON MYSTERY VESSEL/ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The mystery vessel approaches and settles into
geosynchronous orbit. It is positioned slightly above
and to the side of the Enterprise -- and it is a great
deal larger than the Enterprise. Suddenly, A GLOWING
PULSE OF LIGHT throbs out from the mystery vessel toward
the Enterprise.

171 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FULL SHOT

The LIGHT GLOWS OVER EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ON THE
BRIDGE. They are startled by it, but no one is hurt.
As the GLOW FADES AWAY:

PICARD
All stations, give any damage
reports.

The others are looking at each other, shaking their
heads. No problems.

WORF
I would guess we were being
scanned, sir.

172 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

Troi is leaning against the strange, smooth and shining
tunnel wall as if still feeling pain. Riker, obviously
still concerned for Troi, is examining the strange
tunnel walls with the tricorder while Geordi moves his
"eyes" inches away from the surface to examine it
closely. Data is testing his communicator and we'll
HEAR him trying to get a signal back from the
Enterprise.

TASHA
(to Troi)
Pain again?

RIKER
(turning; sharply)
Troi, you've been at it enough!

TROI
No, I feel close to an answer of
some kind.

DATA
(interrupting)
Commander, something down here
is shielding our communicators.

TROI
(comes to her feet)
Yes, that's exactly the feeling
I've been reading. As if someone
doesn't want us to be in touch
with our ship.

RIKER
Come on...
(leads the way)
... let's get to the surface.

173 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL)

The mystery vessel clearly larger than the Enterprise
and moving near it in orbit.

174 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

On which is featured an IMAGE OF MYSTERY VESSEL.

OPERATIONS POSITION
There is no computer record of
any such vessel, sir. Not even
close.

174 CONTINUED:

SECURITY POSITION
Still no response, sir. We've
done everything but threaten them.

PICARD
Sensor scans, Mister Worf.

WORF
Our sensor signals seem to just
bounce off.
(bites off words;
indicates to viewer)
Something's happening, sir...

175 FULL ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

As a beam of something STRIKES DOWNWARD TOWARD THE
PLANET SURFACE. (It doesn't look exactly like the
Enterprise phasers but is the same sort of thing.)

176 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL)

As another phaser-like BEAM STRIKES DOWN AT THE PLANET.

177 INT. BRIDGE

Excitement.

178 ANGLE ON OPS POSITION

WORF
They're firing on Farpoint,
sir... !

PICARD
(toward Security
position)
Bring phasers and photon torpedoes
to ready!

WORF
No, hold it, sir. They're hitting
the Bandi city, not Farpoint
Station.

179 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

Riker and his team racing to where the rounded, smooth
and shining walls of the tunnel begin to give way to
a more ordinary looking rectangular corridor of mixed
stone and tile walls.

180 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING STAIRWAY AHEAD

Riker pulling to a halt in order to examine with
curiosity the blend where the unknown type tunnel walls
give way to stone and tile construction similar to what
we've seen in the old Bandi city. Ahead is a stone
block stairway leading up to that old city. Geordi has
hurried in, peering closely at the more familiar kind
of wall surface.

TROI
(indicates ahead)
Those stairs are where Tasha and
I entered down here, sir.

GEORDI
At this point, it becomes ordinary
stone and tile, sir.
(turns, puzzled)
Matching what's above.

Followed by a LONG RUMBLING EXPLOSION ("PHASER HIT"
type) WITH THE LONG FLASH OF IT REFLECTING DOWN THE
STAIRWAY FROM THE UPPER LEVEL AHEAD. As this SOUND
FADES, then we HEAR A FAINT DISTANT SCREAM which dies
away too.

TASHA
My God! Was that a phaser blast?

DATA
Negative. But something similar.

Again, the SAME KIND OF EXPLOSION SOUND followed by
similar LIGHT FLICKERS from the stairway ahead. Riker
turns to Troi:

RIKER
You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam
up to the ship from here. Now!
(to Data)
Come on, I want to see exactly
what's happening.

Riker starts off to the stairway, Data following.

TROI
Don't. If you should be hurt...

A stern look comes over Riker's face as he turns quickly
to her:

RIKER
You have your orders, Counselor!
Carry them out!

180 CONTINUED:

TROI
Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir.

181 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

Riker and Data begin climbing the stairway, leaving the
CAMERA CENTERED ON TROI, TASHA AND GEORDI. Troi has
already reached for her communicator control.

TROI
Enterprise, three to beam up.

After a moment, the familiar TRANSPORTER SOUND, followed
by TRANSPORTER EFFECT ON THE THREE DISSOLVING INTO THE
LIGHT SPARKLE. Then, they're gone.

182 INT. COVERED VILLAGE SQUARE (OPTICAL)

OLD CITY IN IN B.G. where FIRE RAGES in a smashed
structure in that part of the old city we can see. In
CLOSER FOREGROUND is an entrance to the underground
passageway, this entry guarded by thick, hand-worked
metal door, locked. This village square is a connecting
point between the Old City and Farpoint Station. A
short distance in the OFF-CAMERA DIRECTION lies Farpoint
Mall.

183 THE METAL DOORS (OPTICAL)

We HEAR a hand phaser HUM as a GLOW FLICKERS OVER THE
METAL DOORS which now spring open and a CLASHING OF
METAL SOUND. Riker and Data ENTER SCENE though those
door, phasers in hand.

184 CLOSER - RIKER AND DATA

As Riker touches his communicator control.

RIKER
Enterprise, Riker. Come in.

0T INTERRUPTED BY THE CLOSER SOUND OF A PHASER-LIKE BOLT FROM THE
MYSTERY VESSEL. Also from closer, THE LIGHT OF THE
BLAST REFLECTS ON THEIR FACES and they whirl to see:

186 ANGLE INTO OLD CITY

Where a building is being BLASTED INTO STONES AND DUST.

187 INT. ZORN'S OFFICE - OLD CITY

Filled with the dust and SOUNDS of a nearby BLAST. Zorn
is working frantically with his communicator.

ZORN
Enterprise, Enterprise, help us!
Come in, please...

188 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL)

On MAIN VIEWER THE IMAGE OF THE mystery vessel which
as we watch will FIRE ANOTHER PHASER-LIKE BOLT DOWN
TOWARD THE PLANET. The bridge crew are anxiously poised
on the edge of their seats, waiting for Picard's next
order.

ZORN'S VOICE
... what shall we do? Help us,
please.

PICARD
(overlapping)
Tune him down!
(into transmitter)
Commander Riker, go ahead. Where
are you?

189 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING TURBOLIFT

As the doors SNAP OPEN TO REVEAL TROI, TASHA, AND GEORDI
who hurry onto the bridge, take their regular positions
(Geordi relieving Ops). Meanwhile:

RIKER'S VOICE
With Data, on the edge of the old
city, Captain. It's being hit
hard. Who's doing this?

PICARD
And Farpoint Station? Any damage
there?

190 INT. COVERED VILLAGE SQUARE - FARPOINT MALL IN B.G.

No indication that Farpoint Station has been damaged
at all. Riker, standing with Data, is using his
communicator.

190 CONTINUED:

RIKER
Negative on damage to Farpoint,
sir. Whoever they are, it seems
they're carefully avoiding hitting
the station.

PICARD'S VOICE
It's from an unidentified vessel
that's entered orbit with us here.
No ID, no answer to our signals...

During which there's another BLAST SOUND with the same
kind of LIGHT FLICKERS.

191 ANGLE INCLUDING OLD CITY

As Riker whirls again in that direction, interrupting
Picard:

RIKER
They're hitting the Bandi city
hard, sir. Many casualties very
probable.

192 INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

Everything as we last left it.

PICARD
(into transmitter)
Understand, Commander. Would you
object to a clearly illegal
kidnapping assignment?

RIKER'S VOICE
No objection; anything you order,
sir.

PICARD
Zorn may have the answers we need.
Get Groppler Zorn and bring him
here!

RIKER'S VOICE
Aye, sir!

193 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

Picard looks at the IMAGE of the huge mystery vessel
still in orbit nearby. Picard turns to Troi:

193 CONTINUED:

PICARD
They're forcing a difficult
decision on me, Counselor.

TROI
(nods)
But, I doubt protecting the Bandi
would violate the Prime Directive.
True, they are not actual
allies...

PICARD
But we are in the midst of
diplomatic discussions with them.
(turns to Tasha)
Lock phasers on that vessel,
Lieutenant.

194 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

In b.g., Tasha touching panel controls.

TASHA
Phasers locked on, Captain.

Anything further INTERRUPTED BY OPTICAL EFFECT, the
BLINDING LIGHT FLASH we've seen before and FADING TO
REVEAL "Q", wearing the Judge's costume from the earlier
courtroom sequence. He is standing in front of Picard.

"Q" (JUDGE)
Typical, so typical. Savage
lifeforms never follow even their
own rules.

FADE OUT.

PART NINE

FADE IN:

195 EXT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD AND "Q"

Rather than being nervous over the arrival of "Q"
(JUDGE), Picard has become coldly angry.

PICARD
Get off my bridge!

196 ANOTHER ANGLE

"Q" stepping toward Picard, smiling sadly.

"Q" (JUDGE)
Also interesting, that order about
phasers.

TASHA
(ignoring "Q"; to
Picard)
Still standing by on phasers,
Captain.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(turning to Picard)
Please don't let me interfere.
Use your weapons.

PICARD
You're the one who has a lot to
learn, "Q". With no idea of who's
on that vessel, my order was a
routine safety precaution.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(breaking into LAUGHTER)
Really? No idea of what it
represents? The meaning of that
vessel is as plain as...
(then taps his nose)
... as plain as the noses on your
ugly little primate faces.

196 CONTINUED:

LOUDER LAUGHTER.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(trying to control it)
And if you were truly civilized,
Captain, wouldn't you be doing
something about the casualties
happening down there?

In answer, Picard touches the communications control on
his uniform.

PICARD
Captain to CMO, are you reading
any of this?

197 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE EMPHASIZING BEVERLY

But she's with a half dozen MEDICAL ASSISTANTS very busy
preparing medical supplies, bringing portable medical
equipment, etc.

BEVERLY
Medical teams already preparing
to beam down, Captain.

PICARD'S VOICE
(relieved)
Compliments on that, Doctor!

198 INT. BRIDGE

Picard turning back to "Q".

PICARD
Any questions? Starfleet people
are trained to render aid and
assistance whenever...

"Q" (JUDGE)
(interrupting)
But not trained in clear thinking.

PICARD
Let's consider your thoughts.
You call us "savages" and yet you
knew those people down there would
be killed. You're the one whose
conduct is uncivilized.

WORF
Sir, they're firing on the planet
again.

199 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

Where we SEE the mystery vessel beginning to FIRE BLASTS
down at the planet again.

PICARD
Forcefields full on.
(to Worf)
Go to thrusters! Position us
between that vessel and the
planet.

WORF
Aye, sir, thruster power to...

Worf trails his words, perplexed. His panel is fading,
GOING DARK.

WORF
(continuing)
We have no ship control, sir.
It's gone!

200 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ZORN'S OFFICE - DAY - RIKER AND DATA

They are headed toward Zorn's office door when the BLUE
BOLT HITS beside the door, flooding the scene with a
FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT. The corridor rocks, and the
ceiling comes down partially. Riker and Data are flung
down by the explosion. A beat, and then Data stirs,
sits up. Riker is slower, but is managing to haul
himself upright.

DATA
Are you undamaged?

RIKER
Yes. You?

Data's eyes glaze slightly as he seems to go into a sort
of "trance" that lasts just a few seconds. Then:

DATA
All systems operating.

201 ANGLE INCLUDING ZORN'S OFFICE DOOR

It is hanging by its hinges, and debris-dust is drifting
out of it. Riker and Data move quickly to and through
the open door.

202 INT. ZORN'S OFFICE - DAY - FULL SHOT

As Riker and Data ENTER. The office has been badly
damaged, especially near the door. O.S. THE SOUND OF
ANOTHER BOLT EXPLODING echoes. The room shakes under
the impact. There is a MUFFLED SOB near the desk.

203 CLOSER ANGLE - NEAR DESK

Zorn is cowering under his elegant desk, shaking and
sobbing in fear.

ZORN
Please. You can make it stop.
Drive it away.

RIKER
Drive who away, Groppler?

Zorn reacts as if he knows he's said too much.

ZORN
I don't know.

DATA
Unlikely, sir.
(to Zorn)
Our records show that you
supervised all Bandi contact with
other worlds...

ZORN
We haven't done anything wrong!

RIKER
Then if we can learn nothing from
you, perhaps we'll leave.

ZORN
(frightened)
No! No, don't leave, I'll try
to explain some of...

204 EMPHASIZING ZORN (OPTICAL)

A kind of TRANSPORTER SOUND is heard, and then a
TRANSPORTER EFFECT, somewhat different from the
Starfleet variety, centers on Zorn. He beging SCREAMING
as he FADES FROM VIEW.

205 ANGLE ON RIKER

As he keys his communicator.

205 CONTINUED:

RIKER
First officer to Enterprise.

PICARD'S VOICE
Go ahead, Riker.

RIKER
We've lost Zorn, sir. Something
like a transporter beam, it
snatched him out of here.

206 INT. BRIDGE

"Q" still in the captain's seat, listening to:

RIKER'S VOICE
Question, sir, could it have been
the "Q" character you met earlier.

"Q" (JUDGE)
(laughs)
None of you know who it is?
You're running out of time,
Captain.

207 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND TROI

She's frowning, trying to 'feel' something.

TROI
Captain... Suddenly I'm sensing
something else. It's
satisfaction, enormous
satisfaction.

PICARD
From the same source as before?

TROI
No, that was on the planet.
(indicates)
This seems to be from here.

208 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

And the image of the mystery vessel.

208 CONTINUED:

"Q" (JUDGE)
(to Troi)
Excellent, Counselor!
(indicates Picard)
He's such a dullard, isn't he!

INTERCOM VOICE
Captain from Transporter Room.
First officer and Mister Data now
beaming aboard.

"Q" (JUDGE)
Excellent also!
(to Picard)
Perhaps with more of these little
minds helping, you'll...

209 EMPHASIZING PICARD

As he whirls suddenly on "Q".

PICARD
(interrupting)
That is enough, damn it!

"Q" (JUDGE)
We have an agreement; have you
forgotten... ?

In b.g., the turbolift doors SNAP OPEN but unnoticed by
Picard and "Q" as they continue their argument. Riker
and Data appear, move onto bridge as:

PICARD
We have an agreement which you
are at this moment breaking by
taking over our vessel,
interfering with my decisions!
(steps up nose-to-nose)
You are not welcome on my bridge.
Now, either leave or finish us.
One of the two!

"Q" stands, during which we have the impression that
everyone is holding his breath. Then:

"Q" (JUDGE)
(gently)
Temper, temper, mon capitaine. I
am merely trying to assist a
pitiful species. Perhaps I'll
leave if Mister Riker provides
me with some amusement.

209 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(to Riker)
Do nothing that he asks!

"Q" (JUDGE)
But I ask so little. And it is
so necessary if you are to solve
all this.
(turns; indicates vessel
image in Main Viewer)
Beam over there with your... what
is it called... your "away team"?
(to Picard)
You should already know what
you'll find there. But perhaps
it was too adult a puzzle for you.

RIKER
Captain, with all respect, I
intended to suggest beaming over
there.

210 EMPHASIZING "Q" (OPTICAL)

Amused at all this. He turns from Riker to look at
Picard.

"Q" (JUDGE)
You show promise, my good fellow.

PICARD
But you don't. You should have
long ago realized that, humanity
is NOT a criminal race!

"Q" (JUDGE)
YOU MUST STILL PROVE THAT!

A familiar BLINDING FLASH, and then "Q" is gone.

211 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER

Realizing "Q" is gone, turning to look at each other.
Riker checks a reading on his panel.

RIKER
Of the 24 hours "Q" gave us, we have
less than one left, sir.

211 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(nods)
But I had a feeling you impressed
him, Number One. That's hopeful.

RIKER
Thank you, Captain, That's the
first time you've called me
"Number One".

PICARD
(small smile)
I believe I'll enjoy getting to
know you, Bill. If we live long
enough.

FADE OUT.

PART TEN

FADE IN:
212 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL)

In orbit over the planet.

213 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

Riker's away team moving onto the transporter platform.
With him are Data, Troi, and Tasha. They carry the
usual away team equipment which they're now checking.

RIKER
Phasers on stun.

Everyone checks hand phasers. AD-LIB answers of
"checked", "on stun," etc. Riker turns to Transporter
Chief.

RIKER
Energize.

214 INT. MYSTERY SHIP TUNNEL - WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL)

TRANSPORTER SOUND, then the BEAMING EFFECT. Then, fully
MATERIALIZED, Riker and the others look around to orient
themselves.

DATA
Most interesting, sir.

TASHA
Much the same construction as the
underground tunnel we saw.

Which describes it perfectly. The same rounded shape
and GLOWING WALL of unknown composition. The "tunnel"
is deserted; NO SHIP SOUNDS of any kind.

TASHA
(continuing)
But no sound of power; no
equipment. How does this ship
run?

Riker nods a direction. Tasha takes the point as they
move out. Clearly, these are exceptionally well trained
people. Data is already using his tricorder to check
the walls. He obviously gets nothing, shakes his head.
Troi suddenly staggers, GROANS.

214 CONTINUED:

RIKER
Troi, what is it?!
(waits anxiously)
Is it the same as you felt down
there?

TROI
No, this is... different. It
feels much more powerful... full
of anger... hate...

TASHA
Toward us?

TROI
No. It's directed down toward
the old Bandi city.

DATA
Most intriguing again. The place
that this vessel was firing
upon...
(abruptly stops; to
Riker)
Sorry, sir, I seem to be
commenting on everything.

RIKER
(small smile)
Good. Don't stop it, my friend.

215 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

Enterprise and the mystery vessel still in orbit.

216 INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

Geordi and Worf at their positions. Picard is in the
command seat, antsy.

RIKER'S VOICE
Enterprise, Riker. This is
turning out to be a very long
tunnel or corridor, sir. Still
no sign of mechanism or
circuitry...

217 INT. NARROW MYSTERY SHIP TUNNEL - RIKER AND GROUP

Still led and followed by the security people, they're
now moving along fairly rapidly although this tunnel
is narrower here. Otherwise, its look hasn't changed.

RIKER
(continuing)
... or controls, readouts, nothing
at all like any vessel I've seen
before.

TROI
(interrupting)
Groppler Zorn, sir... in great
fear...
(motions)
Just ahead.

218 INT. TUNNEL CONNECTION

Troi and the team arriving, standing puzzled at what
seems to be only a sharp turn where we SEE a strange
indentation in the tunnel wall there. Troi, intent on
this, steps closer, pushes her body against the
indentation.

TROI
It's definitely Zorn, Commander.
Here!

RIKER
(stepping in)
Careful...

But the tunnel wall is soft here -- it gives
perceptibly, as Troi pushes harder and then PLOP... she
disappears through it. (NOTE: Or the 'wall' opens to
let her through and then closes behind her.)

RIKER
Troi!!!

Then he pushes, disappears through the same wall.

219 INT. ZORN'S "CELL"

Riker sliding through the pliable opening in the tunnel
wall, joining Troi who is standing there aghast at what
is suspended in the center of this area.

220 ANGLE AT FORCE FIELD (OPTICAL)

Zorn is held suspended off the deck in the center of
a cylindrical forcefield. The force field edges GLITTER
SOFTLY to outline the shape of it.

221 ANGLE ON THE AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)

As the other team members come through the 'wall' too,
stand, reacting at the sight of Zorn.

222 ANGLE AT FORCE FIELD (OPTICAL)

The FORCEFIELD SPARKLES, CLICKS, causing Zorn to writhe
and twitch. He SCREAMS.

ZORN
No! Please! No more! Please,
no more...

223 ANGLE ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)

They move forward toward him, and are brought up sharply
by the leading edge of the force field. Data has
already started to scan with his tricorder. Riker calls
to Zorn.

RIKER
(continuing)
Zorn. Can you hear me?

Zorn manages to lift his head, and WE SEE his
pain-filled face, his features twisted into a grimace
of intense agony.

ZORN
Make it stop the pain. Please...

TROI
Has the alien communicated... ?
(breaks off; then to
Riker)
That's it, sir! It's just one
alien that I'm sensing here.

ZORN
(another GROAN)
Please! I don't understand what
it wants.

TROI
(studying Zorn; then)
Not true. He does know.

223 CONTINUED:

Data interrupts by holding his tricorder so that Riker
can see the readings he's gathered. Riker registers
at seeing something unique as Data pulls out his phaser,
Riker does the same and both of them concentrate on
making some exact setting on their phasers.

224 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

As Data and Riker raise their phasers toward Zorn.

ZORN
(in terror)
No, no, please don't!

Data and Riker trigger their phasers and we SEE a SORT
OF COLORED GLOW on the FORCEFIELD HOLDING Zorn, the GLOW
SPREADING OVER THE ENTIRE FORCEFIELD. Then, suddenly
the FORCEFIELD DISAPPEARS, GLOW AND ALL, and Zorn
tumbles out onto the floor free of restraint.

225 EMPHASIZING "LIVE" PART OF CELL WALL (EFFECTS)

Where the wall seems to be "alive", undulating. Beyond
it, Tasha is assisting Zorn to his feet, supporting him.
Meanwhile, Troi looks around Zorn's "cell", sensing
something troubling. Riker has turned on his
communicator:

RIKER
Away team to Enterprise...

A TENDRIL OF PLASMA EMERGES FROM THIS PART OF THE WALL,
swaying and moving toward Troi.

DATA
(interrupting; warning)
Troi... !

But the TENDRIL is already wrapping around her. Data
tries to pull the TENDRIL from Troi, succeeds only in
getting a NEW TENDRIL wrapped around himself.

226 ANOTHER ANGLE (EFFECTS)

The floor of the area suddenly going soft, away team
members sinking into it while still ANOTHER SECTION OF
WALL FOLDS ITSELF OVER TASHA. (What we're seeing is
this part of the mystery "vessel" becoming a living
thing.)

226 CONTINUED:

RIKER
Enterprise, come in. Beam us...

Interrupted as his feet are YANKED OUT FROM UNDER HIM.

DATA
Enterprise, we need help...

Interrupted by the NEW TENDRIL WRAPPING ITSELF AROUND
HIS HEAD.

227 INT. BRIDGE

Picard speaking anxiously toward his command panel as
we HEAR Riker's MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISTRESS.

PICARD
Transporter chief, yank them back!
Now!

WORF
Captain... !

228 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

Toward which Lieutenant Worf is pointing. On it the
IMAGE of the mystery vessel is BEGINNING TO CHANGE IN
SHAPE. The firm, hard edges of the spaceship are giving
way to something softer, very mysterious in nature.

229 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

In which we SEE a familiar BLINDING FLASH and "Q"
appears, now wearing the uniform of a STARFLEET CAPTAIN.

"Q" (STARFLEET)
Your time is up, Captain.

PICARD
Get off my bridge!
(into command panel)
Transporter Chief, do you have
their coordinates?

230 ANOTHER ANGLE (EFFECTS)

"Q" stepping to the command position.

"Q" (STARFLEET)
He can't hear you, Captain.

230 CONTINUED:

"Q" gestures upward, at which Picard is suddenly lifted
into the air and then to the side of "Q"'s hand motion
in that direction.

PICARD
"Q", I've people in trouble over
there... !

As Picard hovers above, "Q" steps up and sits in
Picard's command position. Bridge personnel are coming
to their feet angrily, then hesitate as:

PICARD
(continuing)
Everyone, at ease! That's an
order!
(to "Q")
My people are in trouble, "Q".
Help them; I'll do whatever you
say...

As "Q" gives another hand signal downward, the Captain
is gently deposited onto the deck.

231 WIDE PORTION OF BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

As the same strange transporter SOUND that accompanied
Zorn's "kidnapping" is heard and the same STRANGE
TRANSPORTER EFFECT APPEARS, this time MATERIALIZING FIVE
IMAGES -- Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha, and Groppler Zorn.

232 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD

Very surprised, looking from his away team to "Q".

"Q" (STARFLEET)
You'll do whatever I say?

PICARD
(hesitates; nods)
It seems I did make that bargain.

TROI
The agreement isn't valid, sir.
It wasn't "Q" that saved us.

"Q" (STARFLEET)
(quickly; indicating
viewer)
Save yourselves! It may attack
you now.

233 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

On which the changed IMAGE of the mystery "vessel" seems
to be floating in closer to the Enterprise.

RIKER
It was that which sent us back,
Captain.

TROI
Yes sir. It's not a vessel, sir.
It's alive somehow...

"Q" (STARFLEET)
She lies! Destroy it while you
have a chance.
(to Tasha)
Make phasers and photon torpedoes
ready... !

PICARD
No! Do nothing he suggests!

ZORN
But that thing was killing my
people, Captain...

PICARD
True, but why? Was there a
reason?

"Q" (STARFLEET)
It is an unknown, Captain! Isn't
that enough?

PICARD
If you had earned that uniform
you're wearing, you'd know that
the unknown is what brings us out
here!

"Q" (STARFLEET)
Wasted effort, considering the
human intelligence.

PICARD
Let's test that...
(to Zorn)
... starting with the tunnels you
have under Farpoint, Groppler.

RIKER
Identical to the ones on that
space vessel lifeform, over there.
Why was it punishing you,
Groppler?

233 CONTINUED:

PICARD
In return for pain you caused to
some other creature?

ZORN
We did nothing wrong! It was
injured, we helped it...

PICARD
(interrupting; to Zorn)
Thank you, that was the missing
part.
(turns)
Tasha, rig phasers to deliver an
energy beam.

TASHA
(puzzled)
Aye, sir.

Tasha steps to her panel, makes settings on controls
there.

RIKER
Yes, Captain, I understand now.
It has to be conceivable that
somewhere in the galaxy there
could exist creatures able to
convert energy into matter...

PICARD
(nodding)
And into specific patterns of
matter. Much as our transporters
do.

TASHA
(indicating)
On the viewer, Captain!

234 ANGLE EMPHASIZING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

Where the vessel/creature IMAGE is SOFTENING FURTHER
INTO AN AMORPHOUS, COLORFUL AND LOVELY SHAPE. Picard
turns to the Groppler, demanding:

PICARD
Zorn, you captured something like
that, didn't you?

On main viewer, the IMAGE NOW SHOWS LOVELY FEATHERY
TENDRILS, and it is BEGINNING TO MOVE DOWN TOWARD THE
PLANET. Zorn reacts to this, shows panic.

234 CONTINUED:

ZORN
Warn my people, please! Leave
Farpoint Station immediately!

"Q" (STARFLEET)
He's lied to you, Captain.
Shouldn't you let his people die?

PICARD
(nods to Ops)
Transmit the message. "Leave
Farpoint immediately".

TROI
Then it was a pair of creatures
I was sensing. One down there
in grief and pain, the other up
here, filled with anger...

DATA
(nodding)
And firing not on the new space
station, but on the old Bandi
city.

PICARD
(to "Q")
Attacking those who captured
it's...
(to Troi)
... it's mate?

TASHA
Energy beam ready, sir.

PICARD
(to Tasha)
Lock it in on Farpoint Station.

"Q" stands in an annoyed manner, indicates the captain's
position to Picard.

"Q" (STARFLEET)
I see now it was too simple a
puzzle. But generosity has always
been my weakness.

As "Q" moves aside, Picard takes his position, turning
to Tasha.

PICARD
Let it have whatever it can
absorb. Energize!

235 EXT SPACE - THE ENTERRPISE (OPTICAL)

in orbit, as a THICK, PALE BLUE ENERGY BEAM AIMS
DOWNWARD.

236 EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL)

HIGH DOWNWARD SHOT SHOWING THE ENERGY BEAM terminating
and being absorbed into Farpoint Station.

237 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

Picard and others watching the energy beam terminating
at Farpoint Station.

TASHA
Now getting feedback on the beam,
sir.

PICARD
Discontinue it.
(to Zorn)
Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be
no Farpoint Station if I'm right
about this.

"Q" (STARFLEET)
A lucky guess!

ZORN
I know we deserve this loss, but
please believe me, we meant not
to harm the creature, but to use
it.

TROI
Sir, a feeling of great joy. And
gratitude.

238 EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL)

The city/station miniature -- the Farpoint Station part
of it GROWING SOFT, SHIMMERING, SLOWLY BECOMES A
CREATURE OF GOSSAMER, FEATHERY LIGHTNESS -- now
gracefully rising up from its captivity.

239 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

Where what was once the "mystery vessel" but now an
increasingly beautiful COLORFUL, FEATHERY TENDRIL SHAPE
is descending closer and closer to what was once the
Farpoint Station part of city/station (miniature).

239 CONTINUED:

THE TWO CREATURES (OPTICAL)

The smaller one rising up toward its mate. They touch
-- delicate matter/energy tendrils twining -- and then
together they move upwards out of sight.

240 EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

As the two creatures rise up past it.

241 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

On which the two creatures are rising upward OUT OF
IMAGE FRAME.

TROI
Great joy and gratitude... from
both of them.

242 ANGLE EMPHASIZING "Q" (OPTICAL)

As Picard turns on him.

PICARD
And why? Because it furnishes
entertainment to you! You use
other lifeforms for recreation.

"Q" (STARFLEET)
If so, you've not provided the
best...

PICARD
Get off my ship, you smug
hypocrite.

"Q" (STARFLEET)
Why not? We can also meet
another time, another place.

PICARD
That's doesn't frighten us at
all! You accuse us of "grievous
savagery"? No, the one proven
guilty of that crime is you!

242 CONTINUED:

ANOTHER BLINDING FLASH AND "Q" DISAPPEARS. It takes
a moment to realize that he is gone. Then:

RIKER
I trust this isn't the usual way
our missions will go, sir.

Picard screws up his face in mock consideration of this,
then nods.

PICARD
On no, Number One, I'm sure
they'll be much more interesting.

FADE OUT.

STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION 
"Lonely Among Us" 
TEASER

FADE IN:

1 EXT. SPACE - USS ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)

The great ship orbits a blue-green planet softly cloaked
in a swirl of cloud cover.

PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's log, stardate 41249.3.
We have orbited the two major
planets of the Beta Renner system
taking aboard delegates from
those two worlds. Since achieving
space flight, their major life
forms, the Anticans and the
Selay...

2 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM 4 - ANGLE ON PICARD

in full dress uniform, waiting impatiently near the
platform. O.S. TRANSPORTER SOUND IS BUILDING.

3 ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER

as FIVE FIGURES begin to form in the sparkling
TRANSPORTER EFFECT. As they solidify, they are revealed
as FIVE ALIENS (Selay). The Chief Delegate is SSESTAR.
All Selay are tall and two axhandles across the
shoulders. Their reptilian heads are sinister -- sleek
scaled skin, lipless mouths, and beady eyes. The
markings on their heads are cobra-like, and folds of
skin at the neck imply a cobra hood.

PICARD (V.O.)
(continuing)
... have become deadly enemies.
But both have also applied for
admission into our Federation.
We are to deliver these
delegates to this sector's neutral
Conference Planet called
"Parliament" in the hope their
dispute can be resolved.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 2.

3 CONTINUED

Picard gestures the Selay off the platform with a
somewhat strained smile.

PICARD
I am Captain Picard. We hope
to make this journey pleasant
and comfortable. Arranging
that will be my first officer,
Commander Riker.

4 REVERSE ANGLE - ON RIKER AND TASHA

also in dress uniform, waiting near the Transporter
control console. TASHA concentrates on the Selay
delegates as RIKER steps forward formally.

RIKER
Welcome aboard. If you'll follow
me...
(starts MOVING OFF)
... I'll show you the
accommodations we've...

5 WIDER ANGLE

The Selay leader, Ssestar, interrupts:

SSESTAR
We can already smell the Anticans.
They were taken aboard first?

PICARD
Only because their world was the
first on our heading to
Parliament.

SSESTAR
Will our quarters be near the
Anticans?

PICARD
About one hundred meters apart.
Is that all right?

SSESTAR
No. Unsatisfactory.

Picard starts to frown, but Riker nods to the captain
-- he'll handle it.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 3.

5 CONTINUED

RIKER
I believe we can accommodate their
wishes, Captain.
(to Ssestar)
We'll rearrange suite assignments.
If you'll follow me?

Ssestar hesitates, then grunts an assent and motions
his people to follow as he moves toward the door.

SSESTAR
And we must be upwind from the
Anticans.

RIKER
Of course, sir...

The delegation EXITS with Riker. As they leave and the
DOORS CLOSE:

TASHA
Neither seem very promising
Federation candidates.

Picard nods, begins EXITING with Tasha.

PICARD
Even Parliament's peacemakers may
find this case difficult.

6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The ship moves majestically out of orbit, goes into the
WARP SPEED EFFECT.

7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

All the regular crew at their stations, except for
Geordi and Worf, who are absent. A replacement CONN
OFFICER is at that panel, next to DATA at Ops.

PICARD
(to Riker)
Do you understand the basis of
all that nonsense between them?

RIKER
No sir. I didn't understand that
kind of hostility even when I
studied Earth history.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 4.

7 CONTINUED

PICARD
Oh? Well, yes, but these life
forms feel such passionate hatred
over differences in customs, God
concepts, and even strangely enough,
economic systems...

8 ANOTHER ANGLE

Data has frowned at something on his panel, looks around
at Picard.

DATA
Sir, my sensors are picking up
an unusual energy object ahead.

PICARD
On screen.

Data punches up the command.

9 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

A strange ENERGY PATTERN moving at warp speed.

TASHA
Confirmed, sir. My sensors read
nothing solid but considerable
energy in...
(puzzles over reading)
... in changing patterns.

DATA
Traveling at warp speed, too.
Intriguing.
(tabs panel, looks up)
I can find no match with anything
in our records, sir.

PICARD
(eyes viewer; then)
Change course for a close sensor
pass... we'll then increase warp
speed to reach Parliament on
schedule.

DATA
Aye, sir.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 5.

10 INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON GEORDI AND WORF

The room is small, busy with equipment, including one
key console. GEORDI is leaning over the complicated
console and talking to WORF as he runs a pattern on the
panel.

GEORDI
Why the interest in this, Worf?
It is just routine maintenance
on the sensor assemblies.

WORF
Simple, Geordi. Our captain
wants his junior officers to
learn, learn, learn...

GEORDI
(grins)
Not just the junior ones.
(indicates)
Okay, hold this relay off-line
while...

Worf moves in and takes over as indicated, while:

TASHA'S COM VOICE
Security to Sensor Maintenance.

GEORDI
La Forge here.

11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

TASHA
We're making a close sensor pass
on an unusual object, Geordi.
Any problems?

GEORDI'S COM VOICE
None, Lieutenant. All equipment
on line and functioning.

TASHA
(turns to Captain)
Sensors ready, sir.

PICARD
(to Data)
Life form reading?

DATA
No life form reading, sir.

PICARD
Begin the pass.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 6.

12 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND ENERGY "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

as the Enterprise changes course slightly to intercept
the "cloud."

13 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

as they close rapidly with the object.

DATA
Sir, it is changing shape... !

14 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

The "cloud" bulging out slightly, putting the bulge in
the Enterprise's path.

15 ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA

PICARD
Any readings indicating matter
there?

DATA
Negative, Captain. Energy only.

16 EXT. SPACE - CLOSE ON ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise begins passing just through the wispy
edge of it.

17 INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON WORF AND GEORDI
(OPTICAL)

Worf is where he moved in at the console relay. Geordi
is standing to one side. Suddenly there is a BRIEF GLOW
(OPTICAL) from the key console to Worf. The big Klingon
jerks as though something has struck him, and he
convulses spasmodically and collapses. Geordi tabs his
communicator instantly.

GEORDI
La Forge to Sickbay. Medical
emergency in Sensor Maintenance
Room!

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 7.

17 CONTINUED

MOVE IN CLOSE ON GEORDI as he bends over the crumpled
Klingon.

GEORDI
(continuing)
Repeat -- medical emergency!

FADE OUT.

END OF TEASER

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 8.

ACT ONE

FADE IN:

18 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

plunging through space at warp speed, leaving the
"cloud" behind.

19 INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON WORF AND GEORDI

Worf still lies in a heap on the floor, Geordi leaning
over him and checking for life signs. Worf begins to
stir, slowly at first, as the doors SLIDE OPEN and
Beverly and ASSISTANT ENTER at a dead run, medical
devices in hand. They quickly kneel at Worf, begin
checking him.

BEVERLY
What happened?

GEORDI
Don't know. It seemed like he
was hit by...
(shakes head)
... some sensor feedback, maybe.

Worf suddenly starts to powerfully flail his arms and
legs around, struggling against something we can't see.
The assistant tries to hang on, but Worf's Klingon
strength sends him across the room. Then, as Worf
flails at furniture in his way, easily splitting it,
Beverly has opened the medical kit with quick
efficiency, pulls out a hypospray, and administers it.

20 CLOSER - EMPHASIZING WORF

He stops struggling, looks around with eyes that seem
to be seeing for the first time. An expression of
wonder and amazement crosses his face. Beverly and
Geordi exchange a glance, both clearly concerned.

BEVERLY
Lieutenant Worf?
(no response)
Lieutenant, can you hear what I'm
saying?

Worf manages a sort of grunt, holds up a hand and
stares at it. Then he moves his body, trying to get
his feet under him. He is at first unable to get the
right coordination down, as though this simple act is
as foreign to him as it is to a newborn.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 9.

20 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
(continuing)
Let's get him up.

They rise. Worf watches and sees how they do it. As
they both reach down to boost him by the arms, he
manages to get to his knees and start to push to his
feet. Beverly is studying him closely. He does not
seem violent now; he stares around more like a young and
bewildered child. Beverly nods to Geordi, picks up her
medical kit, and they start to lead Worf OUT. He moves
with them, slowly and carefully putting one foot ahead
of the other.

21 INT. READY ROOM - ANGLE ON GEORDI AND PICARD

Picard is at his desk, Geordi standing before it.
Picard looks up at him, frowning as:

GEORDI
He was just monitoring the sensor
console when he jerked as though
something hit him. What my
sensors showed...
(frowns)
... It was kind of a... glow... just
for a second. I can't explain it.

PICARD
Could your VISOR device have
malfunctioned?

GEORDI
Doubt it, sir. It seemed what
I was seeing was something real.

22 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY, TROI, WORF

Worf lies on an examination table, Beverly and assistant
working over him with her medical scanners. Troi looks
up at the o.s. medical viewscreen, then back at Worf.
The Klingon is quiet now, his eyes moving around the
room and to the women. His attitude is one of quiet and
deep curiosity. Beverly finishes, smiles down at Worf.

BEVERLY
I'm going to give you something
to help you rest. Just relax.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 10.

22 CONTINUED:

Worf's expression remains unchanged. Beverly brings out
a hypospray and activates it on his arm. His eyelids
begin to sag closed almost immediately. Beverly puts
away the hypospray, motions Troi into her office.

23 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - BEVERLY AND TROI

on their ENTRY:

BEVERLY
Fortunately, he's stronger than
an orbital tug. There's nothing
physically wrong with him. What
have you sensed?

TROI
Nothing... which bothers me. He
has never shielded his feelings
from me. I can't understand why
he is suddenly doing it now.

BEVERLY
Are you able to perceive anything
at all, Counselor? It may be
important.

TROI
(beat; concentrating)
Perhaps... very faintly.
Almost... like a frightened
child.

BEVERLY
Worf "frightened?"

TROI
It doesn't make much sense but...
(beat; concentrating)
Yes, it's fear. Definitely there.

They exchange puzzled looks.

24 OMITTED

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 11.

25 INT. BADAR N'D'D'S QUARTERS - ON TASHA AND
BADAR N'D'D

BADAR N'D'D is wraith-thin, pale, with glittering
lupine eyes; and when he curls his mouth in what looks
like a smile, some extremely long, sharp canines are
revealed. His clothing can only be described as
disreputable -- dark and loose, somehow lumpy (as though
it hides body parts we don't want to know about).
Tasha's tremulous smile is offset by a twitch of her
nose that indicates Anticans don't smell too nice.
Riker ENTERS.

TASHA
Sorry to call you, sir, not
strictly security, it's about
the dietary requirements of the
Antican delegates.

26 INTERCUT RIKER AND TASHA

RIKER
I thought that had been taken care
of in advance, Tasha.

TASHA
So did we, sir. Their live
animals were beamed aboard -- We
were going to preserve the meat
for them, but ....
(squeamishly)
... they say we must bring it to
them alive.

RIKER
(beat)
Then do so!
(to the Antican)
Lieutenant Yar was... confused.
We no longer enslave animals
for food purposes.

BADAR N'D'D
But we have seen humans eat meat!

The Antican grins -- a terrifying display of long,
sharp fangs.

RIKER
You've seen something as fresh
and tasty as living meat, but
inorganically materialized out
of patterns used by our
transporters.

BADAR N'D'D
(in revulsion)
How sickening! How barbaric!

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 12.

27 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND WORF (OPTICAL)

Worf lies sedated on one of the beds, being
automatically monitored by the medical computers.
Beverly approaches with a medical instrument in hand
to take some samples. She leans over the bed, using
the instrument on his arm. As she does, there is a
SUDDEN SPLIT-SECOND BURST OF ELECTRIC-LIKE ENERGY
BETWEEN THEM. Beverly is highlighted briefly by a BLUE
GLOW (OPTICAL). She steps back away from the bed,
blinking as if trying to assimilate some new
information.

28 ANOTHER ANGLE

Troi ENTERS from the Corridor. Beverly looks around
at her, puzzled, as Troi moves closer, looking up at
the medical viewscreen.

TROI
He's reading normal? How did you
manage that?

BEVERLY
(dazed)
Yes... normal, now.

TROI
(looks up quickly)
Are you all right?

BEVERLY
Yes... perfectly.

Beverly looks at the medical instrument in her hand,
seems to remember.

BEVERLY
(continuing)
Yes... both of us quite normal.

Beverly ministers to Worf. Worf starts to stir,
shaking his head and blinking as if clearing his head of
something.

WORF
Where... where am I?

TROI
Don't you remember? You were in
the Sensor Maintenance Room ---

WORF
I remember monitoring the sensor
console -- and that's all. What
am I doing here?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 13.

28 CONTINUED:

TROI
That's a story the doctor will
tell you.

She starts to smile over at Beverly, and the smile slips
a little. Beverly is staring at the medical viewer
again, deep in thought, paying no attention to Troi and
Worf.

29 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON DATA AND PICARD (OPTICAL)

at Science Station 1. Data is replaying visual of
"cloud" on the screen for Picard's observation.

DATA
I called it a "cloud" for lack
of a better term at the time.
But the sensor pass shows it as
much more. Combinations very
complex, precise energy
patterns...

PICARD
Constantly interacting on each
other?

DATA
Yes, sir... But whether
individually or as a whole, it
is difficult to say.

PICARD
Obviously, you seem to feel it
should be inspected more closely.

DATA
A mystery is only a mystery as
long as it remains uninvestigated,
sir.

PICARD
Ah. I love a mystery, Mister
Data, but this one has to wait
until we deliver the delegates
to their peace conference on
Parliament.

He walks down the ramp toward his command chair.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 14.

30 INT. CRUSHERS' QUARTERS - ON WESLEY

Wesley is in the living area, working with a P.A.D.D.
and a Viewscreen, quickly tapping commands into the
P.A.D.D. and watching figures or diagrams change on the
o.s. viewer. The quarters doors are HEARD to SLIDE
OPEN, and Wesley looks around.

31 WESLEY'S P.O.V. - BEVERLY

Beverly comes in, looks around apparently startled as
Wesley speaks, but she seems to recover composure
quickly. (NOTE: Throughout, Beverly appears remote,
not displaying her normal warmth toward her son, views
him almost as though he is an interesting stranger.)

WESLEY
Hi Mom. You're back early.

BEVERLY
Yes.

She moves closer to him and looks at the viewer as he
indicates it and the P.A.D.D.

WESLEY
Physical sciences class. We're
studying Doctor Channing's theory
on dilithium crystals.

BEVERLY
Tell me about it.

Wesley looks up at her, slightly puzzled. She never
was interested before -- now her eyes glitter with an
unaccustomed curiosity.

WESLEY
Really? You never seemed that
interested in warp theory before.
(indicates)
Doctor Channing thinks it's
possible to force dilithium into
even more useful crystals. If
as shown here, matter and
antimatter could be aligned even
more efficiently...

BEVERLY
(interrupting)
Would that affect navigation?

WESLEY
This is engineering, not helm
control.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 15.

31 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
Oh yes, the helm's located on the
bridge.

WESLEY
(stares, concerned)
Mom, is something wrong?

Without answering, turns and heads for the door. Wesley
stares after her, frowning, as she EXITS.

32 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

He glances around as the turbolift doors OPEN, and
Beverly ENTERS and advances down the ramp toward Geordi,
back at his helm position. (NOTE: She is still not
acting in her usual manner. Everything about the bridge
seems to be of interest to her, as though she's never
seen it before. She responds with darting, curious
little looks when spoken to, not quite able to focus
long on the person whom she addresses. Her speech
patterns have become very formal, also not like her.
Also notice she does not call the captain by his rank or
address him as "sir.")

BEVERLY
(to herself)
This... is the helm.

Geordi looks up surprised, then grins, nods.

GEORDI
Unless there have been some
changes I don't know about.

PICARD
Doctor Crusher?

BEVERLY
You will wish to know Lieutenant
Worf is much improved. Ready to
report back on duty.

PICARD
What was the diagnosis?

Beverly heads for the upper bridge.

BEVERLY
A temporary mental abberation.

PICARD
When it concerns a bridge officer,
I expect a better explanation,
Doctor.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 16.

32 CONTINUED:

Beverly nods, moves toward the Science Stations.

BEVERLY
Then I must first run some
crosschecks in the
library-computer. Klingons are
so unusual in their reactions,
aren't they?

PICARD
(still puzzled, but:)
Take Science Station Two, Doctor.

33 ANGLE ON BEVERLY (OPTICAL)

moving to where Data is in view too. She begins calling
up information. Innocently, Data glances to her
Viewscreen. What he sees there puzzles but does not
alarm him.

DATA
Intriguing, Doctor. What does
helm control have to do with
medical crosschecks?

She ignores him, then seems satisfied over what she
views. Data has turned back to his own panel -- Beverly
appears to carefully pick out a place in which to touch
her panel again... and as she does so, a blue electronic
EFFECT APPEARS BRIEFLY ON THE PANEL, then quickly
DISAPPEARS. Beverly blinks, then looks around as if
awaking from a dream.

BEVERLY
I... I don't know why I'm...

DATA
(looks up)
Is something wrong, Doctor?

34 ANGLING ON PICARD AND UPPER BRIDGE

Picard looks around, concerned over Beverly seeming to
be disoriented.

PICARD
Doctor, are you all right?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 17.

34 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
Yes... yes. I -- I'll do my work
from my office. That's where I
should be...

She MOVES OFF quickly toward the turbolift. Picard
watches her, still concerned.

PICARD
Do you want someone to accompany
you?

She EXITS into the turbolift. And the doors CLOSE.
Picard turns to Troi.

PICARD
Counselor, what's happening to
my people?

Interrupted by Data at Science Station 1. He suddenly
straightens, frowning.

DATA
Captain? There is a malfunction
in this station. I cannot bring
any information up on it.

He moves quickly to Science Station 2, WE SEE that
console go dead.

DATA
(continuing)
Science Two does not function
either, sir.

35 WIDER ANGLE

Then, quickly, from the communications panel:

SINGH'S COM VOICE
Engineering to Captain Picard.
We have something wrong with warp
drive circuitry, sir.

TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE
Transporter Room Six to bridge.
Reporting transporter console
malfunction, sir.

PICARD
Mister Data, this ship is less
than a year out of spacedock.
What are the chances of all this
occurring?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 18.

35 CONTINUED:

DATA
It is a virtual impossibility,
sir.

PICARD
So what the hell is going on
here?

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT ONE

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 19.

ACT TWO

FADE IN:

36 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

sweeping along at warp speed - nothing to indicate
there's trouble aboard this magnificent machine.

37 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD (OPTICAL)

He is irritated, pacing, snapping off his comments with
a certain amount of acid etching his words. Through
the window WE CAN SEE warp stars flashing past.

PICARD
... I don't understand it,
Gentlemen. I need information.
You're telling me there is no
explanation for any of these
malfunctions?

As he speaks, CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL he has on the
carpet before him Singh, Data, several other Department
Heads. Riker sits beside him feeling no less on the
carpet himself.

RIKER
At least, sir, all department
heads report the damage repaired.

PICARD
That was not the question, Number
One. What caused the
malfunctions?

SINGH
I believe it was a rampant
electronic short that jumped from
system to system, sir. The only
thing is --

PICARD
Yes, Mister Singh?

SINGH
That shouldn't be possible. The
affected systems don't generally
interact with each other -- and
where they do, it wasn't the
interlink that was malfunctioning.

PICARD
Have you spoken with Chief
Engineer Argyle about the problem?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 20.

37 CONTINUED

SINGH
With all the engineering staff,
sir. They're just as puzzled.

PICARD
I am not satisfied with that.
(to the others)
I want explanations of this by
the time we get to Parliament.

SINGH
But...

PICARD
By the time we get to
Parliament, Mr. Singh.

38 INT. BADAR N'D'D'S QUARTERS - ANGLE ON RIKER

This is a "Basic Quarters Suite," without special wall
decorations, fairly simple solid-color furniture. The
Main Room seen here is very low-lit, with dark corners
and shadows prevailing. Riker is speaking firmly as
we COME IN:

RIKER
These weapons were removed
from two of your people who were
loitering out of sight in the
vicinity of the Selay delegation
quarters. Would you care to
explain, sir?

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Riker holding out two
tubes, somewhat resembling Allen wrenches, but with
several curiously shaped buttons along the top of the
"barrel." Riker and Tasha are facing Badar N'D'D, who
glances at the tubes and lifts a disdainful eyebrow.

BADAR N'D'D
Those are not weapons, First
Officer. They are tools we use
to dispatch the animals we consume.

TASHA
Your food supply is not on the
same deck as the Selay delegation,
sir.

RIKER
And you will admit these "tools"
can kill.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 21.

38 CONTINUED

BADAR N'D'D
(shrugs)
Some of my people are impulsive.
and we all have reason to hate
the Selay.

TASHA
They appear to have the same
feelings about you, sir.

BADAR N'D'D
(shrugs again)
That is the nature of politics.

RIKER
Nonetheless, Chief Delegate, I'm
putting you on notice that all
weapons -- no matter what their
basic function -- are being
confiscated. Violence will not
be tolerated on the Enterprise.

BADAR N'D'D
Of course not. And if any does
occur, I can assure you it will
not be we Anticans who start it.

RIKER AND TASHA
Thank you, sir.

They turn and EXIT, taking the two tube weapons with
them. As the DOOR CLOSES behind them:

BADAR N'D'D
(ominously)
But we will finish it.

39 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

blasting along at warp speed.

40 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON SINGH, GEORDI, WESLEY

They are at one of the consoles, Singh doing something
complex at a panel, with Geordi and Wesley looking over
his shoulder.

41 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING WORF

Worf is at Conn, routinely monitoring his panel and
appearing to be no worse for wear after his ordeal.
Suddenly, he straightens, tabs in a command, frowns,
tabs it again.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 22.

41 CONTINUED:

WORF
Sir, warp power is fading!

PICARD
Picard to Engineering. What is
our problem?

WORF
Warp five... four... three...
two...

42 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

EFFECT SHOT of going from WARP SPEED to SUB-WARP.

43 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - EMPHASIZING SINGH

The assistant chief engineer is working the panel,
shaking his head.

SINGH
We've lost the warp engine
computer tie!

WESLEY
And we just dropped below warp
one, sir.

GEORDI
Go to impulse power!

44 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

He frowns, not happy, but he's just the boss around
here. He doesn't make the damned thing go.

PICARD
State of the art vessel? Hah.
Commander Data, signal Parliament
that we will be delayed. We will
send the new arrival time as soon
as determined.

DATA
Yes, sir.

He turns to his Ops panel, inspecting it.

DATA
(continuing)
Sir, subspace radio is out.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 23.

45 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD, RIKER, DATA

Riker and Data sit opposite Picard at the desk. Picard
finishes a review of reports on his viewscreen, snaps
it off irritably.

PICARD
Your theories on the sudden
vulnerability of these systems,
gentlemen?

DATA
If the Enterprise were really this
fragile, sir, she never would have
gotten out of spacedock.
Therefore, her systems failures
are not endemic to the ship, but
are more likely the result of the
actions of an unknown adversary.

RIKER
We have a saboteur aboard.

DATA
I believe I said that.

PICARD
(firmly)
Gentlemen. The question now is,
who. I can't believe it's one
of our people.

RIKER
Agreed. Which leaves someone in
either alien delegation. If the
Ferengi bribed or bought even one
of them, that's all that would
be needed.

DATA
Ferengi contacts have been
detected on both Selay and Antica,
sir.

PICARD
Can any of you suggest another
solution?

RIKER
(amused)
You're sounding like a private
eye, sir.

DATA
Query: private eye?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 24.

45 CONTINUED

PICARD
A private consulting investigator
who solves crimes.

DATA
A most interesting occupation.

PICARD
In the world of fact, it is, Data.
However in literature, criminal
detection becomes a fascinating
exercise.
(a glance to Riker)
The immortal Sherlock Holmes would
have an interesting view of our
mystery, I believe.

Data cocks an eyebrow; WE CAN SEE him mentally making
a note to remember that name. Meanwhile:

RIKER
I'm sure, sir -- but I'm afraid
we have to find our solution
without History's Greatest
Consulting Detective.

46 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON SINGH AND WESLEY

conferring over a panel. Wesley suddenly points to a
pertinent display.

WESLEY
Is it there, Mister Singh? If
the control network breaks at that
point...

SINGH
(nods)
... it bleeds warp engine command
off into dead ends.
(to Wesley)
Excellent. I believe I can
handle it from there, Mister Crusher.

Wesley looks up, disappointed. Now that he's spotted
the problem, he wants to stay for the solution.

WESLEY
But, sir --

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 25.

46 CONTINUED

SINGH
Your schedule shows classwork now.
Sorry.

WESLEY
Yes, sir.
(heads for door; turns)
But I don't learn nearly this much
in school.

SINGH
(smiles)
I tend to agree. But the captain's
orders on this are very clear.

47 INT. CRUSHERS' QUARTERS - ANGLE ON BEVERLY

She is dressed casually, relaxing in a chair, reading.
She glances up and smiles as Wesley ENTERS.

BEVERLY
Solve any new problems today?

WESLEY
I was starting to, maybe, but
Mister Singh sent me off to class.

BEVERLY
Wes -- you're only an acting
ensign.
(slight smile)
You have to let the commissioned
officers do some of the work.

WESLEY
Mom, listen. I've learned more
than they understand. For
example, on Channing's dilithium
crystals theory I was telling you
about...

BEVERLY
(frowns; puzzled)
When did you tell me about that?

WESLEY
This morning. Don't you remember?

Beverly stares at him, starting to grow a little
concerned.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 26.

47 CONTINUED

BEVERLY
Honestly, I don't, Wes.

WESLEY
You asked if the warp engines had
to do with navigation, and I said --

BEVERLY
Why would I have said that?

The two of them look at each other. Why, indeed?

48 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON SINGH (OPTICAL)

working at the console where we saw him earlier. He
is busy, digging into the problem, checking his results
on a viewscreen that pulls up different schematics as
he works the board. He reviews the schematic currently
on the screen, nods to himself, reaches for the panel
again. Suddenly, a BLUE GLOW SURROUNDS HIM (OPTICAL),
and he stiffens, shaking convulsively. A SCREAM is
choked off as the power racks his body -- and he
plummets off the chair to the deck. The BLUE GLOW
FADES... leaving him lying motionless on the floor.
A beat, Worf ENTERS from the Corridor outside
Engineering.

WORF
Mister Singh, the Captain wants --

He pauses a short beat as he sees Singh's body, then
he quickly rushes in to check for heartbeat and pulse.
Nothing.

WORF
(continuing)
Engineering to bridge. Security
alert!

PICARD'S COM VOICE
Picard.

WORF
Lieutenant Worf, sir. I just found
Mister Singh.... he's dead.

FADE OUT.

PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's log, stardate 41249.4.
Assistant Chief Engineer Singh
has been found dead in the Engine
Room Office, cause unknown. We
continue to run on impulse power.

50 INT. READY ROOM - PICARD, RIKER, CRUSHER, TASHA

Tasha is very upset over Singh's death.

PICARD
(to Beverly)
I want the autopsy as soon as
possible, Doctor.

TASHA
Captain, I'm so sorry. To have
one of our people die like this...

PICARD
First, let's find out how he died.
Doctor?

BEVERLY
The autopsy is underway, sir.

PICARD
(to Riker)
It could be... a word you're not
to use...
(leans in; low voice)
...murder. Status of
investigation?

TASHA
Underway.

RIKER
Our best people.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 28.

51 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON WORF, WESLEY, GEORDI

They are clustered around the console where Singh died.
Geordi is examining the panels there; Wesley steps up
from behind, indicates a place on the panel.

WESLEY
Sir, he may have been working
there on restoring warp power.

GEORDI
(eyes panel; then)
According to these readings, we
could go back to warp speed now.

Wesley examines the board, looks up, surprised:

WESLEY
But that wasn't the reading when
I left.

WORF
Singh probably repaired it just
before he was killed.

WESLEY
But he couldn't have fixed it from
here, sir! The problems we saw
were inside the engines!

GEORDI
Who else could have corrected it,
Wes?
(to Worf)
Inform the bridge of engine
status.

52 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD

WORF'S COM VOICE
We now have warp capacity, sir.
All power on line.

54 INT. GUEST QUARTERS - ANGLE ON TASHA, BADAR N'D'D

The quarters are still low-lit, mysterious. Badar N'D'D
reclines on a low couch, looking up at Tasha with
complete disinterest.

BADAR N'D'D
I tolerate these questions,
Lieutenant Yar, because I need
this vessel to get us to
Parliament. Your shipboard
problems do not concern me.

TASHA
They should. Our delays are your
delays.

BADAR N'D'D
(waves it away)
The peace conference will wait
for us.

TASHA
I must ask where you were during
this vessel's Earth hours of 1800
last night and 0700 this morning.

BADAR N'D'D
Eating.

TASHA
Sir, I'm talking about hours
here...

BADAR N'D'D
It was a large meal.
(smiles, revealing sharp
canines)
And an interesting animal.

Tasha grimaces at the idea.

55 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - TROI, BEVERLY, WORF

Troi and Beverly wait.

WORF
You wanted me, Doctor?

BEVERLY
Yes, concerning your memory
blackout.

55 CONTINUED:

WORF
(nods)
I still don't remember having one.

BEVERLY
The same thing happened to me.

TROI
I want to try hypnosis on both
of you. It may restore your
memory as to what happened.

Beverly nods immediately. They turn to Worf who has
hesitated.

WORF
I fear such things, but...

BEVERLY
Fear from you, Worf?

Worf nods.

56 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - DATA, RIKER, TASHA (OPTICAL)

They are gathered in chairs near the windows. (Warp
speed.) Riker and Tasha compare notes on a portable
viewer pad. Data is watching... and smoking a "Sherlock
Holmes" style pipe. Tasha is more troubled by this than
Riker.

TASHA
One thing is clear... Almost all
the "peace" delegates answered
our questions with lies.

DATA
Imprecise, Lieutenant. They
omitted certain truths, which in
itself tells us something.

TASHA
We can learn something from
non-disclosure?

DATA
Oh, indubitably, my good woman.

Tasha gives Riker a puzzled look. Indubitably? My good
woman? During which, Data puffs on the pipe and Tasha
pulls back as he exhales.

Has studied, sir - every case.
(indicates)
As Holmes would have pointed
out... during the time in
question, something was afoot!

TASHA
(uncertain of the word)
"Afoot?"

Riker is becoming amused at Data's playing the "great
detective" role ... and at Tasha's reaction to it.
Meanwhile, Data has ignored Tasha's puzzlement over the
word afoot.

DATA
While both sets of delegates say
they were in their quarters, our
crew locator sensed them passing
here...
(indicates)
... and here.

TASHA
But since they don't show where
they went, we're still in the
dark.

DATA
On the contrary, dear colleague -
on their return they drew medical
supplies appropriate to the
treatment of minor wounds and
abrasions on these life forms.

RIKER
Which, leaves you with only one
conclusion.

DATA
Exactly. That they were too
engaged in their own affairs to
have disabled our ship and
murdered the engineer. Given a
choice, they'd rather kill each
other than any of us. It's
elementary my dear Riker...sir.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 32.

56 CONTINUED: (2)

Tasha has been looking from one to the other during
this. She hesitates now, clearly uncomfortable.

TASHA
Speaking of aberrant behavior...

She isn't joking.

57 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON TROI, BEVERLY AND WORF

Troi has a small machine before her which emits a
resonant, melodic HUM and on which LIGHTS FLASH in a
systematic pattern. She has just finished a "pass" with
it in front of Beverly's face. Beverly sits in the desk
chair in a light hypnotic trance. Worf watches
intently; he has just gone through this himself.

TROI
Beverly... can you hear me?

BEVERLY
Yes.

TROI
I want you to go back in your mind
to the moment when you first
recall this sensation of memory
loss. Please picture it exactly
as it occurred.

BEVERLY
(pause; then:)
He's lying on the hospital bed
sedated. I'm walking up to
him... I---
(distressed)
I -- I -- I --

TROI
Gently...gently. How do you feel
at this moment -- as you lean over
him to take the specimen?

BEVERLY
I... feel... someone else...
something else there too...

TROI
(waits; then:)
Go on.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 33.

57 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
(frowns, shakes head)
I feel crowded. Not alone...
get out. Get out of my mind!

Beverly is tossing her head, as if to shake free of
something. Troi turns to Worf and nods, indicating
Beverly.

TROI
You said almost exactly the same
thing -- as though there were
something else inside you.

58 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - ANGLE ON PICARD, OFFICERS
(OPTICAL)

Picard is at his desk, facing Troi, Beverly, Riker, Data
(with pipe), and Tasha; we're at warp speed as WE COME
IN:

TROI
-- Which confirms the feeling of
duality that I sensed earlier in
both of them.

PICARD
Why didn't you report it?

TROI
Because, sir, I assumed at first
it was the kind of duality we
Betazoids feel in all of you.
(sees Picard's
expression harden)
Even you, sir. When you approach
a decision and ask yourself which
way to go... who are you talking
to?

PICARD
(beat; his expression
still saying
"nonsense")
Your hypnotism revealed another
form of duality?

TROI
Yes, sir. I believe something
invaded them.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 34.

58 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
(nods)
It seems the only possible
conclusion.

Picard stands, paces behind his desk irritably, catches
sight of Data and pipe.

PICARD
Data, let's proceed without the
pipe.

DATA
If you wish, sir...
(sets pipe down)
... but I ask if you take it as
incontrovertible that it cannot
be a family member or one of our
crew?

PICARD
(beat, considering;
then:)
Yes. Very unlikely.

DATA
Then our investigation was
worthwhile, sir. We have eliminated
both the delegates and all our
regular ship's complement.

PICARD
What are you suggesting?

Data is inclined to pick up the pipe again, but
remembers that Picard just issued an order about it.

DATA
I am referring to the Great
Detective's credo, sir. I
quote... "We must fall back on
the old axiom that when other
contingencies fail, whatever
remains, however improbable, must
be the truth."

59 OMITTED

Riker and Picard exchange looks.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 35.

60 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

Geordi is at his usual Conn station; Wesley sits beside
him at Ops. Worf is seated in Riker's chair.
Supernumeraries are at aft stations.

61 CLOSER ON GEORDI AND WESLEY

Wesley is quiet, faintly depressed. Geordi looks over
at him, grins.

GEORDI
Wes, everything's fixed now.

WESLEY
That engine computer net wasn't
repaired, sir. It just suddenly
became all right.

GEORDI
It's the result that counts.
(glances down at panel)
What --- ?

62 WIDER ANGLE - ON COMMAND STATIONS

WORF
What is it?

GEORDI
Helm control just went down.
(works panel - nothing)
She won't respond.

WORF
Bridge to Captain. You're needed
here immediately.

Geordi works the panel controls, without result.

GEORDI
Wes, alert Engineering from your
panel.

WESLEY
(works panel)
Trying...

63 ANGLE AT READY ROOM DOOR

Picard ENTERS bridge fast, Riker, Troi, Tasha, Data
FOLLOWING, moving toward their stations. Beverly
FOLLOWS them out onto the bridge, as:

63 CONTINUED:

PICARD
Report.

WORF
Helm is down, sir. The ship's
running wild ---

64 ANGLE ON PICARD

moving to Geordi at Conn. Picard stands by Geordi.

65 ANGLE ON GEORDI, DATA, WESLEY

Wesley swiftly rises, makes room for Data to take over
the panel. Geordi turns in his seat to look up at
Picard as:

GEORDI
Sir, we dropped to impulse
power --

66 CLOSE ON PICARD

He bends over Geordi. His left hand rests near the
small control panel at Conn.

67 OMITTED

68 CLOSE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)

The strange BLUE GLOW FLASHES around Picard for a split
second, then FADES.

69 INCLUDING GEORDI

staring at Picard.

GEORDI
Sir... ? Are you all right? I
thought I just saw ---

70 ON PICARD

Picard remains sitting stiffly for a beat as though
frozen by what has happened, and then his face takes
on a slightly different expression.

PICARD
I'm fine.
(beat)
Everything is fine now.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN:

71 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

traveling on impulse power, unguided by any human hand.

72 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

Geordi is concerned at something happening at his
position.

PICARD
Why the drop to impulse power,
Lieutenant?

GEORDI
(turns to Picard)
The helm is suddenly
malfunctioning, sir.

PICARD
Malfunctioning? You're wrong --
Look again.

GEORDI
(turning to console)
Sir, I ---

He breaks off, staring at the panel.

RIKER
Mister La Forge?

GEORDI
(a beat; puzzled)
There's nothing wrong with the
helm now. Everything is -- just
as it should be, sir.

PICARD
In that case, make our heading
two-nine-five mark three-seven.

GEORDI
Sir... ?

PICARD
You have a problem with that
heading, Lieutenant?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 39.

72 CONTINUED:

GEORDI
Do you want to double back on our
course, sir?

PICARD
That is what I've ordered.

A puzzled Geordi begins touching helm controls.

73 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

going into a graceful turn which will take her in the
opposite direction. As it finishes the turn, the ship
jumps into warp speed.

74 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

The bridge crew still at their positions.

75 ANGLE ON TROI

concentrating her mind on Picard, uncertain. Picard has
appeared lucid; his order to reverse course is not
contrary to Starfleet policy or out-of-line for a
starship captain.

76 EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER

Picard looks entirely normal, but with a very alert
quality.

RIKER
Captain... I'm puzzled about your
reversing our course.

77 ANGLE ON DATA, RIKER, TROI

exchanging looks of puzzlement. Why double back on
course?

78 INCLUDING PICARD AND GEORDI

PICARD
The energy "cloud," Commander --
I believe it important to have
another look at it.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 40.

78 CONTINUED:

RIKER
Sir, we're behind schedule to
Parliament already ---

PICARD
I believe a very important
scientific discovery awaits us
on this heading.

TROI
(looks up; beat)
Perhaps you'll share your
reasoning on that, sir?

DATA
Yes, since we obtained only
minimal information on our sensor
pass of it.

PICARD
We must go back to learn more.
(to Troi; thin smile)
Counselor... do you believe a ship
captain should explain every
order?

TROI
(beat; shakes her head)
Of course not, sir.

79 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

now heading the opposite direction, going back the way
she came at warp speed.

79A INT. CORRIDOR

Badar N'D'D is being chased down the Corridor by a
SECURITY GUARD.

BADAR N'D'D
I demand to see the captain.

FIRST SECURITY GUARD
Stop, return to your quarters... !

A stateroom door OPENS to REVEAL Ssestar trying to edge
outside past a SECOND SECURITY GUARD there. First
security guard has managed to stop Badar N'D'D who
whirls toward the Selay delegate in revulsion.

79A CONTINUED:

SSESTAR
(indicating Badar N'D'D)
What is that doing on our deck?

BADAR N'D'D
(to Security Guard)
I demand to know why this starship
has changed course!

FIRST SECURITY GUARD
Please return to your quarters,
delegates!

80 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS

Riker, Data, Troi and Geordi as Beverly ENTERS.

RIKER
You're late and you asked for this
confidential meeting.

BEVERLY
Sorry. I was just so troubled
by my talk with the captain.
Something seems wrong... terribly
wrong.

TROI
(hesitant)
I believe I sense something
... different in the Captain ... not
much and maybe I'm incorrect.
(indicates Riker, Data
and Geordi)
They think I may be.

RIKER
(to Troi)
You could be reacting to the
reverse course order.

GEORDI
But that's our captain. It's not
the first time he's done something
unusual.

DATA
A mere change of direction hardly
justifies mutiny.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 42.

80 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
(to Troi)
Exactly what do you believe you're
sensing?

TROI
Exactly?
(shakes head)
It's difficult to put into
words... just a feeling that
he's, well... closed part of his
mind to me.

GEORDI
How can you tell there's something
there that you can't feel?

TROI
As I said... it's hard to say.
I just feel the captain's become
... perhaps dangerous.

RIKER
If he's dangerous...if...

GEORDI
... he'd have to be relieved from
command.
(to Beverly)
Which you're allowed to do... but
it's beaucoup trouble if you're
wrong.

DATA
And at this moment it is all pure
speculation. He has done nothing
to subject the Enterprise to
danger.

BEVERLY
Besides, I'd need a medical log
giving clear evidence of
incapacity.
(to Riker)
You could do it without that
problem...

RIKER
Only if all command officers
agreed it vital to do so. But
he's not showing overt unusual
behavior.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 43.

80 CONTINUED: (2)

TROI
Ultimately he will, I believe...

BEVERLY
Commander, as second in command,
it's still in your corner. I'll
order medical and psychiatric
exams... You'll have to back me
up somehow.

81 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

traveling through space at warp speed. Direction should
be the same as PREVIOUS SHOT.

RIKER (V.O.)
First Officer's log, stardate
41249.5. As I believed, the
senior command officers refused
to relieve the captain from duty
on such slender evidence.

82 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - ANGLE ON PICARD

He looks up as Riker and Beverly ENTER the room and
CROSS to face him over the desk. Picard looks up:

PICARD
Yes?

BEVERLY
I'd like you to come to Sickbay
for some examinations, Captain.

PICARD
Oh?
(nods)
I'll be glad to do that when I'm
free.

BEVERLY
I'd like to conduct them now, sir.

PICARD
Why?
(to Riker)
What can I do for you, Number One?

RIKER
Sir, Counselor Troi has
recommended the examinations.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 44.

82 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(thin smile)
Same question. Why?

83 CLOSER SHOT

Riker firms up.

RIKER
It is my duty to inform the
captain that we believe it
possible that he is under some
kind of alien influence
which... may constitute a danger
to this ship.

Another flicker of a smile from Picard. It never gets
to his eyes, and there's no humor in it.

PICARD
I consider it equally possible
that you two and the counselor
are overworked, and possibly
suffering hallucinations.
(to Beverly)
This is an order... you're to
arrange medical and psychiatric
exams of both yourself and them.
Doctor, you realize you're all
acting strangely?

BEVERLY
I'm concerned that you've suddenly
turned the ship away from...

PICARD
(interrupting; hard)
What's happened to your mind,
Doctor? The search for knowledge
is always our primary mission.
(stands)
I'm sorry but I'm too busy for
this kind of nonsense. Must I
call security to force you to
report to Sickbay?

On his cold, penetrating stare, Riker and Beverly EXIT.

84 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

proceeding on her way back to the "Cloud" at warp
speed.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 45.

85 INT. CORRIDOR NEAR ENGINEERING - ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT

The corridor is oddly low lit. As the turbolift DOORS
OPEN and Riker STEPS OUT, he glances around, frowning
at the lack of light. He starts toward Engineering,
and a SPARKLING LOOP suddenly whips over his head and
around his neck. He lurches back, yanked by the
garrote; then it is abruptly loosened. Riker regains
his balance as the garrote is whipped away from his
neck, and he turns to see:

86 ANOTHER ANGLE - SSESTAR AND RIKER

RIKER
What in hell... ?

The large Reptilian manages what appears to be an
apologetic smile.

SSESTAR
Sorry. Wrong species.

He backs away, still offering the smile, then turns and
HURRIES DOWN the corridor to huddle with four other
Selays. Riker fingers his throat ruefully, goes to a
computer interface on a nearby wall and touches it.

RIKER
Riker to security chief.

TASHA'S COM VOICE
Yar here.

RIKER
Security squad to the Engineering
Deck. The Selays are playing hide
and seek down here -- obviously
with the Anticans --
(rubs throat)
-- and it's a lethal game. I want
them returned to their quarters
under guard.

TASHA'S COM VOICE
Right away, sir.
(hesitantly)
And are you... aware sir, the
captain expects you to take a
medical exam?

RIKER
I'll do it later.

87 OMITTED

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 46.

88 INT. READY ROOM - ANGLE ON PICARD

He is working feverishly at an o.s. personal Viewscreen,
absorbing the information at an intense rate. A CHIME
SOUNDS, and he looks up as though he is not sure at
first what it means. Then he registers and:

PICARD
Come.

89 ANGLE TO INCLUDE BEVERLY

The doors slide OPEN, and Beverly ENTERS. She is in
medical "blues." She is trying to appear relaxed and
confident, but nagging thoughts run around her mind
asking about why she is really here.

PICARD
What do you want?

BEVERLY
I have the results of the exams
you ordered.

She offers a record tape, he tosses it aside and leans
back in his chair... content and confident.

90 OMITTED

91 TWO SHOT - BEVERLY AND PICARD

BEVERLY
You don't care to inspect them?

Picard ignores her, she picks up her courage, moves
closer.

BEVERLY
Please, are you Jean-Luc?

Slowly, Picard looks up, aware of both her and her
physical closeness. He touches her hand. A long
hesitation, then gently:

PICARD
He is here.

BEVERLY
The Jean-Luc I know?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 47.

91 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(nods)
And more.

BEVERLY
The "more" frightens me...

PICARD
And elates us. We wish you could
understand the glorious adventures
ahead.

BEVERLY
You and... ?

PICARD
Soon we'll both be home.

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT FOUR

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 48.

ACT FIVE

FADE IN:

92 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise slows to impulse power as it heads for
the large energy pattern "Cloud" which can be seen in
far b.g.

RIKER (V.O.)
(troubled)
First officer's log, supplemental.
On the orders of... Captain
Picard, we have returned to the
vicinity of the energy pattern
"cloud." I am personally
convinced that something from this
"cloud" now shares...

93 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE SHOT

All officers at their regular duty stations, except for
Picard, who is not present. Riker is in the command
chair.

RIKER (V.O.)
(continuing)
... the captain's mind. But there
seems to be nothing we can do...
at least within regulations.
There have been no actions
warranting relieving Captain
Picard. And our medical
personnel, while dubious about
his condition, are not prepared
to certify the captain's
incapacity.

At the Conn position, Geordi turns to look back at
Riker.

GEORDI
Approaching the "cloud," sir.

RIKER
Very well, Mister La Forge. Bring
us to within ten thousand
kilometers and hold us there.

GEORDI
Aye, sir.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 49.

93 CONTINUED:

Picard ENTERS from his Ready Room. Riker gets out of
the command chair.

RIKER
Shall we begin the scientific
tests that you wanted, sir?

PICARD
(smiles)
They are already underway.

94 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

The energy pattern "shape" spreads out across the reach
of space, as we saw it earlier.

95 EMPHASIZING PICARD

as he looks at the viewscreen. His face is transformed,
showing longing and even a kind of love. Then he turns
to the bridge.

PICARD
I have an announcement for the
entire bridge.

96 PICARD AND VIEWER (OPTICAL)

Reaction and concern from all on the bridge as Picard
moves to stand in front of the viewscreen.

PICARD
As many of you suspected...
(indicating "cloud"
image)
... when our ship passed through
the edge of this, it accidentally
carried off a sentient being... one
much like these energy patterns
we're seeing here.

Picard moves toward Worf.

97 VARIOUS ANGLE ON PRINCIPALS

as Picard moves to the helm.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 50.

97 CONTINUED:

PICARD
A frightening experience for any
intelligent being. As if a great
claw reached down and scooped up
any of you from your home world.
Drawn into the energy pathways
of this vessel...
(to Worf)
... it found its way to you, Worf,
frantic at being carried from its
home. Recognizing you as
sentient beings, it pleaded for
help.

98 SHOT OF COMMAND AREA

Picard moving toward where Beverly stands nearby.

PICARD
... but in ways you could not
understand... going desperately
from one to another of you...
then discovering the computer
intelligence in the ship's memory
circuits.
(nods)
Simplistic intelligence, but it
furnished a way to slow this
Enterprise thing that had captured
it.
(toward Riker)
And it very much regrets the
accidental death of Engineer Singh
during this...

TROI
(interrupting)
Captain, do you exist in
combination with the entity?

RIKER)
Is it in control of you, sir?

PICARD)
(that smile again)
By the time we combined...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 51.

99 REACTION ANGLES

as the bridge crew hears him admit the entity is now
part of him.

PICARD
... We had learned much about each
other... our passion for
exploration... for the unknown.
We found we had similar
dreams... and it offered your
captain a way to realize them
beyond any human expectation.

RIKER
Captain, I must speak to you
privately...now.

DATA
I understand. As an energy
pattern free of the limitations
of matter... it might travel
anywhere, at any velocity...

RIKER
(angry)
Captain, did you hear me?

DATA
(intent on Picard)
Sir, I see no way for you to
journey with an energy form.

PICARD
(ignoring Riker)
Isn't there?

TROI
(reacting to a thought)
Maybe... just maybe...
(to Riker)
He's planning to beam both the
entity and himself into that
"cloud."

PICARD
(nods)
The transporter need not pattern
your captain back into matter...
we'll beam energy only...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 52.

100 ANGLE INCLUDING BEVERLY

reacting in some disgust and anger at his words and
expression now.

PICARD
(ecstatic)
... and we will become...
(pleased look)
... a combined energy pattern of
that life form.

101 ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA - INCLUDING BEVERLY

as Picard turns to Riker.

PICARD
A resignation from this command
and from Starfleet has been
appropriately recorded...

RIKER
(moving in; firmly)
I refuse to allow this, sir.

PICARD
Oh? Under what Fleet regulation?
Does this resignation threaten
the ship and its company in any
way?

BEVERLY
(moving in)
Captain Picard, you are now
relieved from duty. I judge you
disabled...

102 ANGLE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)

moving his hand toward a nearby panel.

BEVERLY (O.S.)
... mentally incapacitated...

Picard's hand touches the panel and WE SEE the familiar
BLUE GLOW, at which the panel becomes a BRILLIANT
DISPLAY OF LIGHT on a darkened bridge. Surprised VOICES
and GROANS, all matched to:

RIKER (O.S.)
Security! Help me restrain the
Captain...

turbolift, the door CLOSING.

105 ANGLE ON RIKER (OPTICAL)

Intermittently ILLUMINATED BY THE BRILLIANT FLASHES as
he gets zapped again, then again, struggling to reach
the captain's panel.

RIKER
Hang on to the captain, someone!

He makes it, hits the RED ALERT switch... which SOUNDS
THE KLAXON and begins the RED ALARM LIGHTS BLINKING.

106 INT. CORRIDOR

Darkened too, but the FLASHING RED LIGHTS illuminate
Picard turning into the Transporter Room.

107 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

where a crewman lies unconscious. Picard, relieved to
see the crewman stirring somewhat, makes a setting on
the transporter panel, jumps to the platform as WE HEAR
the TRANSPORTER SOUND begin.

The Enterprise hovers even closer to the "cloud,"
waiting.

110 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

Riker is in the command chair -- all others at their
usual stations except Tasha who ENTERS very concerned
and upset. Riker glances around the bridge, then:

TASHA
The Transporter Chief has no idea
of what the coordinates were, sir.

GEORDI
He's just out there "somewhere?"
How can we settle for that?

RIKER
Give me a choice, then.

DATA
Still no readings, no sign of
anything.

Long hesitation; then, Riker sighs.

RIKER
Mister La Forge, it's time to
set a course for Parliament. Warp
eight.

GEORDI
We're really leaving him... ?

RIKER
I've waited as long as possible,
Lieutenant.

111 EMPHASIZING TROI

She stiffens suddenly in her seat, reaching out to grab
Riker's arm.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 55.

111 CONTINUED:

TROI
Wait! I'm feeling... yes, it's
the captain!
(concentrating)
The captain only. He's out there
alone!

RIKER
The entity... has it abandoned him?

TROI
Aban... ? No, the combination just
wasn't possible out there.
(intently; fast)
The Captain's in trouble, sir;
we must beam him back!

RIKER
Beam him back as what? He's
nothing but energy now.

112 ANGLE INCLUDING GEORDI

turning to Riker, matching his pace. Time may be
important to the Captain now.

DATA
Sir, the entity was caught by
the ship's circuitry -- the
captain might try to get in the
same way if he's in trouble!

RIKER
(to Geordi)
Move the ship in closer!

As Geordi turns, hurriedly doing so.

GEORDI
Moving in, sir. But where?

RIKER
No way to know. Let's hope he
can come part way himself.

The Command Area with Riker and Troi -- then Beverly
ENTERS with Wesley. She indicates her son to Riker,
questioningly. Riker nods, goes back to his intent
examination of the viewer.

RIKER
Troi, is there any way you can...
"get" a message to him?

TROI
(shakes head sadly)
I wish I could.

117 SHOT INCLUDING DATA

as he swivels toward Riker.

GEORDI
Sensors are monitoring our
perimeter, the ship's circuitry...
(shakes head)
Nothing, sir.

RIKER
(interrupting)
Take us into the edge of it, La
Forge.

As he looks toward the Main Viewer:

118 FULL ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

The "cloud" moving toward us -- then we're into it.

119 COMMAND AREA

Riker still intent on the viewer.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 57.

119 CONTINUED:

WESLEY
Mom, is he gone for good?

Beverly shushes her son. He tries almost a whisper:

WESLEY)
(continuing)
The funny thing is, I... I sort
of liked him...

120 INCLUDING TASHA AND WORF (OPTICAL)

Worf is suddenly startled by a reading on his panel.

WORF
Sir! On my sensor controls...

A sudden BLUE GLOW APPEARS, like that which earlier
indicated the entity's presence. Followed by a CRACKLE
OF ENERGY which sees Worf stepping back, alarmed.

TROI
Something's here. I can feel it!

DATA
Just as before! Going to you
first, Worf...

GEORDI
(interrupting)
Something crazy on my viewer
circuits...
(looking toward Viewer)
Commander Riker!

Riker leaps toward Geordi's station.

121 FULL ON GEORDI'S VIEWER (OPTICAL)

An area of static is APPEARING. The STATIC IMAGE is
undefined at first but is becoming a "shape," although
not yet recognizeable.

121A INCLUDING COMMAND AND HELM AREAS

Very curious.

GEORDI
"Static?"

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 58.

121B FULL ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

The STATIC IMAGE as if with great effort, slowly forms
itself into a lop-sided IMAGE of the letter "P."

122 INCLUDING COMMAND AND HELM AREAS

Riker coming to his feet.

RIKER
"P" for Picard!

Data moves quickly toward Riker.

DATA
He's in the ship's circuitry!
Come to the Transporter Room.
Please!

Data HURRIES toward the turbolift. Then he turns.

DATA
(continuing)
There might be a way, sir! Hurry!

Riker decides to HURRY to the turbolift himself. He
joins Data and the turbolift doors CLOSE.

123 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

moving away, the "cloud" now in b.g.

124 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

where Data makes quick adjustments at the control
panel.

RIKER
This is a wild theory Data!

DATA
I knew we had to have the
captain's physical pattern here,
He was the last one beamed out.

RIKER
Is what you're thinking possible?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 59.

124 CONTINUED:

DATA
Unknown at this time, sir. I
hope the captain remembers his
pattern is here.
(steps back)
If he has, his energy has moved
into the transporter relays by
now...

RIKER
(nods)
Wish we had some sign he's there.
(waits; then)
We've no choice but to risk it.

DATA
(nodding)
Energizing, sir!

125 SHOT INCLUDING TRANSPORTER PLATFORM

as Data engages the transporter. Riker waits...waits.

126 TWO SHOT OF RIKER AND DATA

watching anxiously, their disappointment building. They
exchange a worried look.

127 TRANSPORTER PLATFORM (OPTICAL)

The TRANSPORTER EFFECT builds slowly, a bit unevenly...
then firms up, finally MATERIALIZING PICARD. He looks
around, surprised.

PICARD
What the devil am I doing here?!

RIKER
(quietly)
Sounds like our Captain...

Picard begins MOVING OFF the platform.

DATA
But confused. This Picard-pattern
was formed before he went out
there...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 60.

127 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(to Riker)
What's happening to me, Number
One? I was ready to beam away...
somewhere... I remember talk of
an... an entity? But all that
seems so vague...

DATA
(to Riker)
I believe the Captain is now his
separate self, sir. A lot of what
happened is naturally missing...

PICARD
(interrupting)
Data, what nonsense are you
talking now? Is it still
"Sherlock Holmes?"

Data hesitates, exchanging a look with Riker who gives
an almost imperceptible nod.

DATA
Ah, yes. Indubitably, sir,
indubitably.

PICARD
(beginning to EXIT)
Well, at least get rid of that
damned pipe. It smells.

As the captain ALMOST EXITS, Riker intercepts him.

RIKER
Doctor Crusher asked me to steer
you past Sickbay. She says you've
looked very tired.

Tasha ENTERS hurriedly.

TASHA
Sorry Commander, but Security Team
Two reports they've discovered
a puddle of blood outside the
Selay Quarters and they can't
find one of the delegates and...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 61.

127 CONTINUED: (2)

RIKER
(interrupting; annoyed)
Lieutenant, couldn't this have
waited a moment? We've got the
captain back.

TASHA
(to Picard)
Good to see you, sir. The problem
is that one of the cooks has just
been asked to broil Reptile for
the Anticans... and it looks like
the Selay delegate...

PICARD
Riker, with these "peace"
delegates and all, I do need some
rest. Take charge, Number One.

128 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The "cloud" in far b.g. as WE SEE the Enterprise go into
WARP SPEED EFFECT.

FADE OUT.

STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION 
"Lonely Among Us" 
TEASER

FADE IN:

1 EXT. SPACE - USS ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)

The great ship orbits a blue-green planet softly cloaked
in a swirl of cloud cover.

PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's log, stardate 41249.3.
We have orbited the two major
planets of the Beta Renner system
taking aboard delegates from
those two worlds. Since achieving
space flight, their major life
forms, the Anticans and the
Selay...

2 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM 4 - ANGLE ON PICARD

in full dress uniform, waiting impatiently near the
platform. O.S. TRANSPORTER SOUND IS BUILDING.

3 ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER

as FIVE FIGURES begin to form in the sparkling
TRANSPORTER EFFECT. As they solidify, they are revealed
as FIVE ALIENS (Selay). The Chief Delegate is SSESTAR.
All Selay are tall and two axhandles across the
shoulders. Their reptilian heads are sinister -- sleek
scaled skin, lipless mouths, and beady eyes. The
markings on their heads are cobra-like, and folds of
skin at the neck imply a cobra hood.

PICARD (V.O.)
(continuing)
... have become deadly enemies.
But both have also applied for
admission into our Federation.
We are to deliver these
delegates to this sector's neutral
Conference Planet called
"Parliament" in the hope their
dispute can be resolved.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 2.

3 CONTINUED

Picard gestures the Selay off the platform with a
somewhat strained smile.

PICARD
I am Captain Picard. We hope
to make this journey pleasant
and comfortable. Arranging
that will be my first officer,
Commander Riker.

4 REVERSE ANGLE - ON RIKER AND TASHA

also in dress uniform, waiting near the Transporter
control console. TASHA concentrates on the Selay
delegates as RIKER steps forward formally.

RIKER
Welcome aboard. If you'll follow
me...
(starts MOVING OFF)
... I'll show you the
accommodations we've...

5 WIDER ANGLE

The Selay leader, Ssestar, interrupts:

SSESTAR
We can already smell the Anticans.
They were taken aboard first?

PICARD
Only because their world was the
first on our heading to
Parliament.

SSESTAR
Will our quarters be near the
Anticans?

PICARD
About one hundred meters apart.
Is that all right?

SSESTAR
No. Unsatisfactory.

Picard starts to frown, but Riker nods to the captain
-- he'll handle it.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 3.

5 CONTINUED

RIKER
I believe we can accommodate their
wishes, Captain.
(to Ssestar)
We'll rearrange suite assignments.
If you'll follow me?

Ssestar hesitates, then grunts an assent and motions
his people to follow as he moves toward the door.

SSESTAR
And we must be upwind from the
Anticans.

RIKER
Of course, sir...

The delegation EXITS with Riker. As they leave and the
DOORS CLOSE:

TASHA
Neither seem very promising
Federation candidates.

Picard nods, begins EXITING with Tasha.

PICARD
Even Parliament's peacemakers may
find this case difficult.

6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The ship moves majestically out of orbit, goes into the
WARP SPEED EFFECT.

7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

All the regular crew at their stations, except for
Geordi and Worf, who are absent. A replacement CONN
OFFICER is at that panel, next to DATA at Ops.

PICARD
(to Riker)
Do you understand the basis of
all that nonsense between them?

RIKER
No sir. I didn't understand that
kind of hostility even when I
studied Earth history.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 4.

7 CONTINUED

PICARD
Oh? Well, yes, but these life
forms feel such passionate hatred
over differences in customs, God
concepts, and even strangely enough,
economic systems...

8 ANOTHER ANGLE

Data has frowned at something on his panel, looks around
at Picard.

DATA
Sir, my sensors are picking up
an unusual energy object ahead.

PICARD
On screen.

Data punches up the command.

9 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

A strange ENERGY PATTERN moving at warp speed.

TASHA
Confirmed, sir. My sensors read
nothing solid but considerable
energy in...
(puzzles over reading)
... in changing patterns.

DATA
Traveling at warp speed, too.
Intriguing.
(tabs panel, looks up)
I can find no match with anything
in our records, sir.

PICARD
(eyes viewer; then)
Change course for a close sensor
pass... we'll then increase warp
speed to reach Parliament on
schedule.

DATA
Aye, sir.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 5.

10 INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON GEORDI AND WORF

The room is small, busy with equipment, including one
key console. GEORDI is leaning over the complicated
console and talking to WORF as he runs a pattern on the
panel.

GEORDI
Why the interest in this, Worf?
It is just routine maintenance
on the sensor assemblies.

WORF
Simple, Geordi. Our captain
wants his junior officers to
learn, learn, learn...

GEORDI
(grins)
Not just the junior ones.
(indicates)
Okay, hold this relay off-line
while...

Worf moves in and takes over as indicated, while:

TASHA'S COM VOICE
Security to Sensor Maintenance.

GEORDI
La Forge here.

11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

TASHA
We're making a close sensor pass
on an unusual object, Geordi.
Any problems?

GEORDI'S COM VOICE
None, Lieutenant. All equipment
on line and functioning.

TASHA
(turns to Captain)
Sensors ready, sir.

PICARD
(to Data)
Life form reading?

DATA
No life form reading, sir.

PICARD
Begin the pass.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 6.

12 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND ENERGY "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

as the Enterprise changes course slightly to intercept
the "cloud."

13 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

as they close rapidly with the object.

DATA
Sir, it is changing shape... !

14 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

The "cloud" bulging out slightly, putting the bulge in
the Enterprise's path.

15 ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA

PICARD
Any readings indicating matter
there?

DATA
Negative, Captain. Energy only.

16 EXT. SPACE - CLOSE ON ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise begins passing just through the wispy
edge of it.

17 INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON WORF AND GEORDI
(OPTICAL)

Worf is where he moved in at the console relay. Geordi
is standing to one side. Suddenly there is a BRIEF GLOW
(OPTICAL) from the key console to Worf. The big Klingon
jerks as though something has struck him, and he
convulses spasmodically and collapses. Geordi tabs his
communicator instantly.

GEORDI
La Forge to Sickbay. Medical
emergency in Sensor Maintenance
Room!

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER 7.

17 CONTINUED

MOVE IN CLOSE ON GEORDI as he bends over the crumpled
Klingon.

GEORDI
(continuing)
Repeat -- medical emergency!

FADE OUT.

END OF TEASER

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 8.

ACT ONE

FADE IN:

18 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

plunging through space at warp speed, leaving the
"cloud" behind.

19 INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON WORF AND GEORDI

Worf still lies in a heap on the floor, Geordi leaning
over him and checking for life signs. Worf begins to
stir, slowly at first, as the doors SLIDE OPEN and
Beverly and ASSISTANT ENTER at a dead run, medical
devices in hand. They quickly kneel at Worf, begin
checking him.

BEVERLY
What happened?

GEORDI
Don't know. It seemed like he
was hit by...
(shakes head)
... some sensor feedback, maybe.

Worf suddenly starts to powerfully flail his arms and
legs around, struggling against something we can't see.
The assistant tries to hang on, but Worf's Klingon
strength sends him across the room. Then, as Worf
flails at furniture in his way, easily splitting it,
Beverly has opened the medical kit with quick
efficiency, pulls out a hypospray, and administers it.

20 CLOSER - EMPHASIZING WORF

He stops struggling, looks around with eyes that seem
to be seeing for the first time. An expression of
wonder and amazement crosses his face. Beverly and
Geordi exchange a glance, both clearly concerned.

BEVERLY
Lieutenant Worf?
(no response)
Lieutenant, can you hear what I'm
saying?

Worf manages a sort of grunt, holds up a hand and
stares at it. Then he moves his body, trying to get
his feet under him. He is at first unable to get the
right coordination down, as though this simple act is
as foreign to him as it is to a newborn.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 9.

20 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
(continuing)
Let's get him up.

They rise. Worf watches and sees how they do it. As
they both reach down to boost him by the arms, he
manages to get to his knees and start to push to his
feet. Beverly is studying him closely. He does not
seem violent now; he stares around more like a young and
bewildered child. Beverly nods to Geordi, picks up her
medical kit, and they start to lead Worf OUT. He moves
with them, slowly and carefully putting one foot ahead
of the other.

21 INT. READY ROOM - ANGLE ON GEORDI AND PICARD

Picard is at his desk, Geordi standing before it.
Picard looks up at him, frowning as:

GEORDI
He was just monitoring the sensor
console when he jerked as though
something hit him. What my
sensors showed...
(frowns)
... It was kind of a... glow... just
for a second. I can't explain it.

PICARD
Could your VISOR device have
malfunctioned?

GEORDI
Doubt it, sir. It seemed what
I was seeing was something real.

22 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY, TROI, WORF

Worf lies on an examination table, Beverly and assistant
working over him with her medical scanners. Troi looks
up at the o.s. medical viewscreen, then back at Worf.
The Klingon is quiet now, his eyes moving around the
room and to the women. His attitude is one of quiet and
deep curiosity. Beverly finishes, smiles down at Worf.

BEVERLY
I'm going to give you something
to help you rest. Just relax.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 10.

22 CONTINUED:

Worf's expression remains unchanged. Beverly brings out
a hypospray and activates it on his arm. His eyelids
begin to sag closed almost immediately. Beverly puts
away the hypospray, motions Troi into her office.

23 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - BEVERLY AND TROI

on their ENTRY:

BEVERLY
Fortunately, he's stronger than
an orbital tug. There's nothing
physically wrong with him. What
have you sensed?

TROI
Nothing... which bothers me. He
has never shielded his feelings
from me. I can't understand why
he is suddenly doing it now.

BEVERLY
Are you able to perceive anything
at all, Counselor? It may be
important.

TROI
(beat; concentrating)
Perhaps... very faintly.
Almost... like a frightened
child.

BEVERLY
Worf "frightened?"

TROI
It doesn't make much sense but...
(beat; concentrating)
Yes, it's fear. Definitely there.

They exchange puzzled looks.

24 OMITTED

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 11.

25 INT. BADAR N'D'D'S QUARTERS - ON TASHA AND
BADAR N'D'D

BADAR N'D'D is wraith-thin, pale, with glittering
lupine eyes; and when he curls his mouth in what looks
like a smile, some extremely long, sharp canines are
revealed. His clothing can only be described as
disreputable -- dark and loose, somehow lumpy (as though
it hides body parts we don't want to know about).
Tasha's tremulous smile is offset by a twitch of her
nose that indicates Anticans don't smell too nice.
Riker ENTERS.

TASHA
Sorry to call you, sir, not
strictly security, it's about
the dietary requirements of the
Antican delegates.

26 INTERCUT RIKER AND TASHA

RIKER
I thought that had been taken care
of in advance, Tasha.

TASHA
So did we, sir. Their live
animals were beamed aboard -- We
were going to preserve the meat
for them, but ....
(squeamishly)
... they say we must bring it to
them alive.

RIKER
(beat)
Then do so!
(to the Antican)
Lieutenant Yar was... confused.
We no longer enslave animals
for food purposes.

BADAR N'D'D
But we have seen humans eat meat!

The Antican grins -- a terrifying display of long,
sharp fangs.

RIKER
You've seen something as fresh
and tasty as living meat, but
inorganically materialized out
of patterns used by our
transporters.

BADAR N'D'D
(in revulsion)
How sickening! How barbaric!

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 12.

27 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND WORF (OPTICAL)

Worf lies sedated on one of the beds, being
automatically monitored by the medical computers.
Beverly approaches with a medical instrument in hand
to take some samples. She leans over the bed, using
the instrument on his arm. As she does, there is a
SUDDEN SPLIT-SECOND BURST OF ELECTRIC-LIKE ENERGY
BETWEEN THEM. Beverly is highlighted briefly by a BLUE
GLOW (OPTICAL). She steps back away from the bed,
blinking as if trying to assimilate some new
information.

28 ANOTHER ANGLE

Troi ENTERS from the Corridor. Beverly looks around
at her, puzzled, as Troi moves closer, looking up at
the medical viewscreen.

TROI
He's reading normal? How did you
manage that?

BEVERLY
(dazed)
Yes... normal, now.

TROI
(looks up quickly)
Are you all right?

BEVERLY
Yes... perfectly.

Beverly looks at the medical instrument in her hand,
seems to remember.

BEVERLY
(continuing)
Yes... both of us quite normal.

Beverly ministers to Worf. Worf starts to stir,
shaking his head and blinking as if clearing his head of
something.

WORF
Where... where am I?

TROI
Don't you remember? You were in
the Sensor Maintenance Room ---

WORF
I remember monitoring the sensor
console -- and that's all. What
am I doing here?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 13.

28 CONTINUED:

TROI
That's a story the doctor will
tell you.

She starts to smile over at Beverly, and the smile slips
a little. Beverly is staring at the medical viewer
again, deep in thought, paying no attention to Troi and
Worf.

29 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON DATA AND PICARD (OPTICAL)

at Science Station 1. Data is replaying visual of
"cloud" on the screen for Picard's observation.

DATA
I called it a "cloud" for lack
of a better term at the time.
But the sensor pass shows it as
much more. Combinations very
complex, precise energy
patterns...

PICARD
Constantly interacting on each
other?

DATA
Yes, sir... But whether
individually or as a whole, it
is difficult to say.

PICARD
Obviously, you seem to feel it
should be inspected more closely.

DATA
A mystery is only a mystery as
long as it remains uninvestigated,
sir.

PICARD
Ah. I love a mystery, Mister
Data, but this one has to wait
until we deliver the delegates
to their peace conference on
Parliament.

He walks down the ramp toward his command chair.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 14.

30 INT. CRUSHERS' QUARTERS - ON WESLEY

Wesley is in the living area, working with a P.A.D.D.
and a Viewscreen, quickly tapping commands into the
P.A.D.D. and watching figures or diagrams change on the
o.s. viewer. The quarters doors are HEARD to SLIDE
OPEN, and Wesley looks around.

31 WESLEY'S P.O.V. - BEVERLY

Beverly comes in, looks around apparently startled as
Wesley speaks, but she seems to recover composure
quickly. (NOTE: Throughout, Beverly appears remote,
not displaying her normal warmth toward her son, views
him almost as though he is an interesting stranger.)

WESLEY
Hi Mom. You're back early.

BEVERLY
Yes.

She moves closer to him and looks at the viewer as he
indicates it and the P.A.D.D.

WESLEY
Physical sciences class. We're
studying Doctor Channing's theory
on dilithium crystals.

BEVERLY
Tell me about it.

Wesley looks up at her, slightly puzzled. She never
was interested before -- now her eyes glitter with an
unaccustomed curiosity.

WESLEY
Really? You never seemed that
interested in warp theory before.
(indicates)
Doctor Channing thinks it's
possible to force dilithium into
even more useful crystals. If
as shown here, matter and
antimatter could be aligned even
more efficiently...

BEVERLY
(interrupting)
Would that affect navigation?

WESLEY
This is engineering, not helm
control.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 15.

31 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
Oh yes, the helm's located on the
bridge.

WESLEY
(stares, concerned)
Mom, is something wrong?

Without answering, turns and heads for the door. Wesley
stares after her, frowning, as she EXITS.

32 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

He glances around as the turbolift doors OPEN, and
Beverly ENTERS and advances down the ramp toward Geordi,
back at his helm position. (NOTE: She is still not
acting in her usual manner. Everything about the bridge
seems to be of interest to her, as though she's never
seen it before. She responds with darting, curious
little looks when spoken to, not quite able to focus
long on the person whom she addresses. Her speech
patterns have become very formal, also not like her.
Also notice she does not call the captain by his rank or
address him as "sir.")

BEVERLY
(to herself)
This... is the helm.

Geordi looks up surprised, then grins, nods.

GEORDI
Unless there have been some
changes I don't know about.

PICARD
Doctor Crusher?

BEVERLY
You will wish to know Lieutenant
Worf is much improved. Ready to
report back on duty.

PICARD
What was the diagnosis?

Beverly heads for the upper bridge.

BEVERLY
A temporary mental abberation.

PICARD
When it concerns a bridge officer,
I expect a better explanation,
Doctor.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 16.

32 CONTINUED:

Beverly nods, moves toward the Science Stations.

BEVERLY
Then I must first run some
crosschecks in the
library-computer. Klingons are
so unusual in their reactions,
aren't they?

PICARD
(still puzzled, but:)
Take Science Station Two, Doctor.

33 ANGLE ON BEVERLY (OPTICAL)

moving to where Data is in view too. She begins calling
up information. Innocently, Data glances to her
Viewscreen. What he sees there puzzles but does not
alarm him.

DATA
Intriguing, Doctor. What does
helm control have to do with
medical crosschecks?

She ignores him, then seems satisfied over what she
views. Data has turned back to his own panel -- Beverly
appears to carefully pick out a place in which to touch
her panel again... and as she does so, a blue electronic
EFFECT APPEARS BRIEFLY ON THE PANEL, then quickly
DISAPPEARS. Beverly blinks, then looks around as if
awaking from a dream.

BEVERLY
I... I don't know why I'm...

DATA
(looks up)
Is something wrong, Doctor?

34 ANGLING ON PICARD AND UPPER BRIDGE

Picard looks around, concerned over Beverly seeming to
be disoriented.

PICARD
Doctor, are you all right?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 17.

34 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
Yes... yes. I -- I'll do my work
from my office. That's where I
should be...

She MOVES OFF quickly toward the turbolift. Picard
watches her, still concerned.

PICARD
Do you want someone to accompany
you?

She EXITS into the turbolift. And the doors CLOSE.
Picard turns to Troi.

PICARD
Counselor, what's happening to
my people?

Interrupted by Data at Science Station 1. He suddenly
straightens, frowning.

DATA
Captain? There is a malfunction
in this station. I cannot bring
any information up on it.

He moves quickly to Science Station 2, WE SEE that
console go dead.

DATA
(continuing)
Science Two does not function
either, sir.

35 WIDER ANGLE

Then, quickly, from the communications panel:

SINGH'S COM VOICE
Engineering to Captain Picard.
We have something wrong with warp
drive circuitry, sir.

TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE
Transporter Room Six to bridge.
Reporting transporter console
malfunction, sir.

PICARD
Mister Data, this ship is less
than a year out of spacedock.
What are the chances of all this
occurring?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE 18.

35 CONTINUED:

DATA
It is a virtual impossibility,
sir.

PICARD
So what the hell is going on
here?

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT ONE

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 19.

ACT TWO

FADE IN:

36 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

sweeping along at warp speed - nothing to indicate
there's trouble aboard this magnificent machine.

37 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD (OPTICAL)

He is irritated, pacing, snapping off his comments with
a certain amount of acid etching his words. Through
the window WE CAN SEE warp stars flashing past.

PICARD
... I don't understand it,
Gentlemen. I need information.
You're telling me there is no
explanation for any of these
malfunctions?

As he speaks, CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL he has on the
carpet before him Singh, Data, several other Department
Heads. Riker sits beside him feeling no less on the
carpet himself.

RIKER
At least, sir, all department
heads report the damage repaired.

PICARD
That was not the question, Number
One. What caused the
malfunctions?

SINGH
I believe it was a rampant
electronic short that jumped from
system to system, sir. The only
thing is --

PICARD
Yes, Mister Singh?

SINGH
That shouldn't be possible. The
affected systems don't generally
interact with each other -- and
where they do, it wasn't the
interlink that was malfunctioning.

PICARD
Have you spoken with Chief
Engineer Argyle about the problem?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 20.

37 CONTINUED

SINGH
With all the engineering staff,
sir. They're just as puzzled.

PICARD
I am not satisfied with that.
(to the others)
I want explanations of this by
the time we get to Parliament.

SINGH
But...

PICARD
By the time we get to
Parliament, Mr. Singh.

38 INT. BADAR N'D'D'S QUARTERS - ANGLE ON RIKER

This is a "Basic Quarters Suite," without special wall
decorations, fairly simple solid-color furniture. The
Main Room seen here is very low-lit, with dark corners
and shadows prevailing. Riker is speaking firmly as
we COME IN:

RIKER
These weapons were removed
from two of your people who were
loitering out of sight in the
vicinity of the Selay delegation
quarters. Would you care to
explain, sir?

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Riker holding out two
tubes, somewhat resembling Allen wrenches, but with
several curiously shaped buttons along the top of the
"barrel." Riker and Tasha are facing Badar N'D'D, who
glances at the tubes and lifts a disdainful eyebrow.

BADAR N'D'D
Those are not weapons, First
Officer. They are tools we use
to dispatch the animals we consume.

TASHA
Your food supply is not on the
same deck as the Selay delegation,
sir.

RIKER
And you will admit these "tools"
can kill.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 21.

38 CONTINUED

BADAR N'D'D
(shrugs)
Some of my people are impulsive.
and we all have reason to hate
the Selay.

TASHA
They appear to have the same
feelings about you, sir.

BADAR N'D'D
(shrugs again)
That is the nature of politics.

RIKER
Nonetheless, Chief Delegate, I'm
putting you on notice that all
weapons -- no matter what their
basic function -- are being
confiscated. Violence will not
be tolerated on the Enterprise.

BADAR N'D'D
Of course not. And if any does
occur, I can assure you it will
not be we Anticans who start it.

RIKER AND TASHA
Thank you, sir.

They turn and EXIT, taking the two tube weapons with
them. As the DOOR CLOSES behind them:

BADAR N'D'D
(ominously)
But we will finish it.

39 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

blasting along at warp speed.

40 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON SINGH, GEORDI, WESLEY

They are at one of the consoles, Singh doing something
complex at a panel, with Geordi and Wesley looking over
his shoulder.

41 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING WORF

Worf is at Conn, routinely monitoring his panel and
appearing to be no worse for wear after his ordeal.
Suddenly, he straightens, tabs in a command, frowns,
tabs it again.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 22.

41 CONTINUED:

WORF
Sir, warp power is fading!

PICARD
Picard to Engineering. What is
our problem?

WORF
Warp five... four... three...
two...

42 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

EFFECT SHOT of going from WARP SPEED to SUB-WARP.

43 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - EMPHASIZING SINGH

The assistant chief engineer is working the panel,
shaking his head.

SINGH
We've lost the warp engine
computer tie!

WESLEY
And we just dropped below warp
one, sir.

GEORDI
Go to impulse power!

44 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

He frowns, not happy, but he's just the boss around
here. He doesn't make the damned thing go.

PICARD
State of the art vessel? Hah.
Commander Data, signal Parliament
that we will be delayed. We will
send the new arrival time as soon
as determined.

DATA
Yes, sir.

He turns to his Ops panel, inspecting it.

DATA
(continuing)
Sir, subspace radio is out.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 23.

45 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD, RIKER, DATA

Riker and Data sit opposite Picard at the desk. Picard
finishes a review of reports on his viewscreen, snaps
it off irritably.

PICARD
Your theories on the sudden
vulnerability of these systems,
gentlemen?

DATA
If the Enterprise were really this
fragile, sir, she never would have
gotten out of spacedock.
Therefore, her systems failures
are not endemic to the ship, but
are more likely the result of the
actions of an unknown adversary.

RIKER
We have a saboteur aboard.

DATA
I believe I said that.

PICARD
(firmly)
Gentlemen. The question now is,
who. I can't believe it's one
of our people.

RIKER
Agreed. Which leaves someone in
either alien delegation. If the
Ferengi bribed or bought even one
of them, that's all that would
be needed.

DATA
Ferengi contacts have been
detected on both Selay and Antica,
sir.

PICARD
Can any of you suggest another
solution?

RIKER
(amused)
You're sounding like a private
eye, sir.

DATA
Query: private eye?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 24.

45 CONTINUED

PICARD
A private consulting investigator
who solves crimes.

DATA
A most interesting occupation.

PICARD
In the world of fact, it is, Data.
However in literature, criminal
detection becomes a fascinating
exercise.
(a glance to Riker)
The immortal Sherlock Holmes would
have an interesting view of our
mystery, I believe.

Data cocks an eyebrow; WE CAN SEE him mentally making
a note to remember that name. Meanwhile:

RIKER
I'm sure, sir -- but I'm afraid
we have to find our solution
without History's Greatest
Consulting Detective.

46 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON SINGH AND WESLEY

conferring over a panel. Wesley suddenly points to a
pertinent display.

WESLEY
Is it there, Mister Singh? If
the control network breaks at that
point...

SINGH
(nods)
... it bleeds warp engine command
off into dead ends.
(to Wesley)
Excellent. I believe I can
handle it from there, Mister Crusher.

Wesley looks up, disappointed. Now that he's spotted
the problem, he wants to stay for the solution.

WESLEY
But, sir --

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 25.

46 CONTINUED

SINGH
Your schedule shows classwork now.
Sorry.

WESLEY
Yes, sir.
(heads for door; turns)
But I don't learn nearly this much
in school.

SINGH
(smiles)
I tend to agree. But the captain's
orders on this are very clear.

47 INT. CRUSHERS' QUARTERS - ANGLE ON BEVERLY

She is dressed casually, relaxing in a chair, reading.
She glances up and smiles as Wesley ENTERS.

BEVERLY
Solve any new problems today?

WESLEY
I was starting to, maybe, but
Mister Singh sent me off to class.

BEVERLY
Wes -- you're only an acting
ensign.
(slight smile)
You have to let the commissioned
officers do some of the work.

WESLEY
Mom, listen. I've learned more
than they understand. For
example, on Channing's dilithium
crystals theory I was telling you
about...

BEVERLY
(frowns; puzzled)
When did you tell me about that?

WESLEY
This morning. Don't you remember?

Beverly stares at him, starting to grow a little
concerned.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT TWO 26.

47 CONTINUED

BEVERLY
Honestly, I don't, Wes.

WESLEY
You asked if the warp engines had
to do with navigation, and I said --

BEVERLY
Why would I have said that?

The two of them look at each other. Why, indeed?

48 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON SINGH (OPTICAL)

working at the console where we saw him earlier. He
is busy, digging into the problem, checking his results
on a viewscreen that pulls up different schematics as
he works the board. He reviews the schematic currently
on the screen, nods to himself, reaches for the panel
again. Suddenly, a BLUE GLOW SURROUNDS HIM (OPTICAL),
and he stiffens, shaking convulsively. A SCREAM is
choked off as the power racks his body -- and he
plummets off the chair to the deck. The BLUE GLOW
FADES... leaving him lying motionless on the floor.
A beat, Worf ENTERS from the Corridor outside
Engineering.

WORF
Mister Singh, the Captain wants --

He pauses a short beat as he sees Singh's body, then
he quickly rushes in to check for heartbeat and pulse.
Nothing.

WORF
(continuing)
Engineering to bridge. Security
alert!

PICARD'S COM VOICE
Picard.

WORF
Lieutenant Worf, sir. I just found
Mister Singh.... he's dead.

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT TWO

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 27.

ACT THREE

FADE IN:

49 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

moving through space on IMPULSE POWER.

PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's log, stardate 41249.4.
Assistant Chief Engineer Singh
has been found dead in the Engine
Room Office, cause unknown. We
continue to run on impulse power.

50 INT. READY ROOM - PICARD, RIKER, CRUSHER, TASHA

Tasha is very upset over Singh's death.

PICARD
(to Beverly)
I want the autopsy as soon as
possible, Doctor.

TASHA
Captain, I'm so sorry. To have
one of our people die like this...

PICARD
First, let's find out how he died.
Doctor?

BEVERLY
The autopsy is underway, sir.

PICARD
(to Riker)
It could be... a word you're not
to use...
(leans in; low voice)
...murder. Status of
investigation?

TASHA
Underway.

RIKER
Our best people.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 28.

51 INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ANGLE ON WORF, WESLEY, GEORDI

They are clustered around the console where Singh died.
Geordi is examining the panels there; Wesley steps up
from behind, indicates a place on the panel.

WESLEY
Sir, he may have been working
there on restoring warp power.

GEORDI
(eyes panel; then)
According to these readings, we
could go back to warp speed now.

Wesley examines the board, looks up, surprised:

WESLEY
But that wasn't the reading when
I left.

WORF
Singh probably repaired it just
before he was killed.

WESLEY
But he couldn't have fixed it from
here, sir! The problems we saw
were inside the engines!

GEORDI
Who else could have corrected it,
Wes?
(to Worf)
Inform the bridge of engine
status.

52 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD

WORF'S COM VOICE
We now have warp capacity, sir.
All power on line.

PICARD
Well done. Warp engines ready.
(to conn)
On previous heading, warp factor
six.

53 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The ship leaps into warp, the stars blurring as she
makes the jump.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 29.

54 INT. GUEST QUARTERS - ANGLE ON TASHA, BADAR N'D'D

The quarters are still low-lit, mysterious. Badar N'D'D
reclines on a low couch, looking up at Tasha with
complete disinterest.

BADAR N'D'D
I tolerate these questions,
Lieutenant Yar, because I need
this vessel to get us to
Parliament. Your shipboard
problems do not concern me.

TASHA
They should. Our delays are your
delays.

BADAR N'D'D
(waves it away)
The peace conference will wait
for us.

TASHA
I must ask where you were during
this vessel's Earth hours of 1800
last night and 0700 this morning.

BADAR N'D'D
Eating.

TASHA
Sir, I'm talking about hours
here...

BADAR N'D'D
It was a large meal.
(smiles, revealing sharp
canines)
And an interesting animal.

Tasha grimaces at the idea.

55 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - TROI, BEVERLY, WORF

as Worf APPEARS at the door of Beverly's office where
Troi and Beverly wait.

WORF
You wanted me, Doctor?

BEVERLY
Yes, concerning your memory
blackout.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 30.

55 CONTINUED:

WORF
(nods)
I still don't remember having one.

BEVERLY
The same thing happened to me.

TROI
I want to try hypnosis on both
of you. It may restore your
memory as to what happened.

Beverly nods immediately. They turn to Worf who has
hesitated.

WORF
I fear such things, but...

BEVERLY
Fear from you, Worf?

Worf nods.

56 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - DATA, RIKER, TASHA (OPTICAL)

They are gathered in chairs near the windows. (Warp
speed.) Riker and Tasha compare notes on a portable
viewer pad. Data is watching... and smoking a "Sherlock
Holmes" style pipe. Tasha is more troubled by this than
Riker.

TASHA
One thing is clear... Almost all
the "peace" delegates answered
our questions with lies.

DATA
Imprecise, Lieutenant. They
omitted certain truths, which in
itself tells us something.

TASHA
We can learn something from
non-disclosure?

DATA
Oh, indubitably, my good woman.

Tasha gives Riker a puzzled look. Indubitably? My good
woman? During which, Data puffs on the pipe and Tasha
pulls back as he exhales.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 31.

56 CONTINUED:

RIKER
It's something the Captain
mentioned. Sherlock Holmes, which
Data is obviously studying...

DATA
(interrupting)
Has studied, sir - every case.
(indicates)
As Holmes would have pointed
out... during the time in
question, something was afoot!

TASHA
(uncertain of the word)
"Afoot?"

Riker is becoming amused at Data's playing the "great
detective" role ... and at Tasha's reaction to it.
Meanwhile, Data has ignored Tasha's puzzlement over the
word afoot.

DATA
While both sets of delegates say
they were in their quarters, our
crew locator sensed them passing
here...
(indicates)
... and here.

TASHA
But since they don't show where
they went, we're still in the
dark.

DATA
On the contrary, dear colleague -
on their return they drew medical
supplies appropriate to the
treatment of minor wounds and
abrasions on these life forms.

RIKER
Which, leaves you with only one
conclusion.

DATA
Exactly. That they were too
engaged in their own affairs to
have disabled our ship and
murdered the engineer. Given a
choice, they'd rather kill each
other than any of us. It's
elementary my dear Riker...sir.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 32.

56 CONTINUED: (2)

Tasha has been looking from one to the other during
this. She hesitates now, clearly uncomfortable.

TASHA
Speaking of aberrant behavior...

She isn't joking.

57 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON TROI, BEVERLY AND WORF

Troi has a small machine before her which emits a
resonant, melodic HUM and on which LIGHTS FLASH in a
systematic pattern. She has just finished a "pass" with
it in front of Beverly's face. Beverly sits in the desk
chair in a light hypnotic trance. Worf watches
intently; he has just gone through this himself.

TROI
Beverly... can you hear me?

BEVERLY
Yes.

TROI
I want you to go back in your mind
to the moment when you first
recall this sensation of memory
loss. Please picture it exactly
as it occurred.

BEVERLY
(pause; then:)
He's lying on the hospital bed
sedated. I'm walking up to
him... I---
(distressed)
I -- I -- I --

TROI
Gently...gently. How do you feel
at this moment -- as you lean over
him to take the specimen?

BEVERLY
I... feel... someone else...
something else there too...

TROI
(waits; then:)
Go on.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 33.

57 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
(frowns, shakes head)
I feel crowded. Not alone...
get out. Get out of my mind!

Beverly is tossing her head, as if to shake free of
something. Troi turns to Worf and nods, indicating
Beverly.

TROI
You said almost exactly the same
thing -- as though there were
something else inside you.

58 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - ANGLE ON PICARD, OFFICERS
(OPTICAL)

Picard is at his desk, facing Troi, Beverly, Riker, Data
(with pipe), and Tasha; we're at warp speed as WE COME
IN:

TROI
-- Which confirms the feeling of
duality that I sensed earlier in
both of them.

PICARD
Why didn't you report it?

TROI
Because, sir, I assumed at first
it was the kind of duality we
Betazoids feel in all of you.
(sees Picard's
expression harden)
Even you, sir. When you approach
a decision and ask yourself which
way to go... who are you talking
to?

PICARD
(beat; his expression
still saying
"nonsense")
Your hypnotism revealed another
form of duality?

TROI
Yes, sir. I believe something
invaded them.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT THREE 34.

58 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
(nods)
It seems the only possible
conclusion.

Picard stands, paces behind his desk irritably, catches
sight of Data and pipe.

PICARD
Data, let's proceed without the
pipe.

DATA
If you wish, sir...
(sets pipe down)
... but I ask if you take it as
incontrovertible that it cannot
be a family member or one of our
crew?

PICARD
(beat, considering;
then:)
Yes. Very unlikely.

DATA
Then our investigation was
worthwhile, sir. We have eliminated
both the delegates and all our
regular ship's complement.

PICARD
What are you suggesting?

Data is inclined to pick up the pipe again, but
remembers that Picard just issued an order about it.

DATA
I am referring to the Great
Detective's credo, sir. I
quote... "We must fall back on
the old axiom that when other
contingencies fail, whatever
remains, however improbable, must
be the truth."

59 OMITTED

Riker and Picard exchange looks.

60 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

Geordi is at his usual Conn station; Wesley sits beside
him at Ops. Worf is seated in Riker's chair.
Supernumeraries are at aft stations.

61 CLOSER ON GEORDI AND WESLEY

Wesley is quiet, faintly depressed. Geordi looks over
at him, grins.

GEORDI
Wes, everything's fixed now.

WESLEY
That engine computer net wasn't
repaired, sir. It just suddenly
became all right.

GEORDI
It's the result that counts.
(glances down at panel)
What --- ?

62 WIDER ANGLE - ON COMMAND STATIONS

WORF
What is it?

GEORDI
Helm control just went down.
(works panel - nothing)
She won't respond.

WORF
Bridge to Captain. You're needed
here immediately.

Geordi works the panel controls, without result.

GEORDI
Wes, alert Engineering from your
panel.

WESLEY
(works panel)
Trying...

63 ANGLE AT READY ROOM DOOR

Picard ENTERS bridge fast, Riker, Troi, Tasha, Data
FOLLOWING, moving toward their stations. Beverly
FOLLOWS them out onto the bridge, as:

63 CONTINUED:

PICARD
Report.

WORF
Helm is down, sir. The ship's
running wild ---

64 ANGLE ON PICARD

moving to Geordi at Conn. Picard stands by Geordi.

65 ANGLE ON GEORDI, DATA, WESLEY

Wesley swiftly rises, makes room for Data to take over
the panel. Geordi turns in his seat to look up at
Picard as:

GEORDI
Sir, we dropped to impulse
power --

66 CLOSE ON PICARD

He bends over Geordi. His left hand rests near the
small control panel at Conn.

67 OMITTED

68 CLOSE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)

The strange BLUE GLOW FLASHES around Picard for a split
second, then FADES.

69 INCLUDING GEORDI

staring at Picard.

GEORDI
Sir... ? Are you all right? I
thought I just saw ---

70 ON PICARD

Picard remains sitting stiffly for a beat as though
frozen by what has happened, and then his face takes
on a slightly different expression.

FADE IN:

71 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

traveling on impulse power, unguided by any human hand.

72 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

Geordi is concerned at something happening at his
position.

PICARD
Why the drop to impulse power,
Lieutenant?

GEORDI
(turns to Picard)
The helm is suddenly
malfunctioning, sir.

PICARD
Malfunctioning? You're wrong --
Look again.

GEORDI
(turning to console)
Sir, I ---

He breaks off, staring at the panel.

RIKER
Mister La Forge?

GEORDI
(a beat; puzzled)
There's nothing wrong with the
helm now. Everything is -- just
as it should be, sir.

PICARD
In that case, make our heading
two-nine-five mark three-seven.

GEORDI
Sir... ?

PICARD
You have a problem with that
heading, Lieutenant?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 39.

72 CONTINUED:

GEORDI
Do you want to double back on our
course, sir?

PICARD
That is what I've ordered.

A puzzled Geordi begins touching helm controls.

73 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

going into a graceful turn which will take her in the
opposite direction. As it finishes the turn, the ship
jumps into warp speed.

74 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

The bridge crew still at their positions.

75 ANGLE ON TROI

concentrating her mind on Picard, uncertain. Picard has
appeared lucid; his order to reverse course is not
contrary to Starfleet policy or out-of-line for a
starship captain.

76 EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER

Picard looks entirely normal, but with a very alert
quality.

RIKER
Captain... I'm puzzled about your
reversing our course.

77 ANGLE ON DATA, RIKER, TROI

exchanging looks of puzzlement. Why double back on
course?

78 INCLUDING PICARD AND GEORDI

PICARD
The energy "cloud," Commander --
I believe it important to have
another look at it.

78 CONTINUED:

RIKER
Sir, we're behind schedule to
Parliament already ---

PICARD
I believe a very important
scientific discovery awaits us
on this heading.

TROI
(looks up; beat)
Perhaps you'll share your
reasoning on that, sir?

DATA
Yes, since we obtained only
minimal information on our sensor
pass of it.

PICARD
We must go back to learn more.
(to Troi; thin smile)
Counselor... do you believe a ship
captain should explain every
order?

TROI
(beat; shakes her head)
Of course not, sir.

79 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

now heading the opposite direction, going back the way
she came at warp speed.

79A INT. CORRIDOR

Badar N'D'D is being chased down the Corridor by a

80 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS

Riker, Data, Troi and Geordi as Beverly ENTERS.

RIKER
You're late and you asked for this
confidential meeting.

BEVERLY
Sorry. I was just so troubled
by my talk with the captain.
Something seems wrong... terribly
wrong.

TROI
(hesitant)
I believe I sense something
... different in the Captain ... not
much and maybe I'm incorrect.
(indicates Riker, Data
and Geordi)
They think I may be.

RIKER
(to Troi)
You could be reacting to the
reverse course order.

GEORDI
But that's our captain. It's not
the first time he's done something
unusual.

DATA
A mere change of direction hardly
justifies mutiny.

80 CONTINUED:

BEVERLY
(to Troi)
Exactly what do you believe you're
sensing?

TROI
Exactly?
(shakes head)
It's difficult to put into
words... just a feeling that
he's, well... closed part of his
mind to me.

GEORDI
How can you tell there's something
there that you can't feel?

TROI
As I said... it's hard to say.
I just feel the captain's become
... perhaps dangerous.

RIKER
If he's dangerous...if...

GEORDI
... he'd have to be relieved from
command.
(to Beverly)
Which you're allowed to do... but
it's beaucoup trouble if you're
wrong.

DATA
And at this moment it is all pure
speculation. He has done nothing
to subject the Enterprise to
danger.

BEVERLY
Besides, I'd need a medical log
giving clear evidence of
incapacity.
(to Riker)
You could do it without that
problem...

RIKER
Only if all command officers
agreed it vital to do so. But
he's not showing overt unusual
behavior.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 43.

80 CONTINUED: (2)

TROI
Ultimately he will, I believe...

BEVERLY
Commander, as second in command,
it's still in your corner. I'll
order medical and psychiatric
exams... You'll have to back me
up somehow.

81 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

traveling through space at warp speed. Direction should
be the same as PREVIOUS SHOT.

RIKER (V.O.)
First Officer's log, stardate
41249.5. As I believed, the
senior command officers refused
to relieve the captain from duty
on such slender evidence.

82 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - ANGLE ON PICARD

He looks up as Riker and Beverly ENTER the room and
CROSS to face him over the desk. Picard looks up:

PICARD
Yes?

BEVERLY
I'd like you to come to Sickbay
for some examinations, Captain.

PICARD
Oh?
(nods)
I'll be glad to do that when I'm
free.

BEVERLY
I'd like to conduct them now, sir.

PICARD
Why?
(to Riker)
What can I do for you, Number One?

RIKER
Sir, Counselor Troi has
recommended the examinations.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 44.

82 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(thin smile)
Same question. Why?

83 CLOSER SHOT

Riker firms up.

RIKER
It is my duty to inform the
captain that we believe it
possible that he is under some
kind of alien influence
which... may constitute a danger
to this ship.

Another flicker of a smile from Picard. It never gets
to his eyes, and there's no humor in it.

PICARD
I consider it equally possible
that you two and the counselor
are overworked, and possibly
suffering hallucinations.
(to Beverly)
This is an order... you're to
arrange medical and psychiatric
exams of both yourself and them.
Doctor, you realize you're all
acting strangely?

BEVERLY
I'm concerned that you've suddenly
turned the ship away from...

PICARD
(interrupting; hard)
What's happened to your mind,
Doctor? The search for knowledge
is always our primary mission.
(stands)
I'm sorry but I'm too busy for
this kind of nonsense. Must I
call security to force you to
report to Sickbay?

On his cold, penetrating stare, Riker and Beverly EXIT.

84 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

proceeding on her way back to the "Cloud" at warp
speed.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 45.

85 INT. CORRIDOR NEAR ENGINEERING - ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT

The corridor is oddly low lit. As the turbolift DOORS
OPEN and Riker STEPS OUT, he glances around, frowning
at the lack of light. He starts toward Engineering,
and a SPARKLING LOOP suddenly whips over his head and
around his neck. He lurches back, yanked by the
garrote; then it is abruptly loosened. Riker regains
his balance as the garrote is whipped away from his
neck, and he turns to see:

86 ANOTHER ANGLE - SSESTAR AND RIKER

RIKER
What in hell... ?

The large Reptilian manages what appears to be an
apologetic smile.

SSESTAR
Sorry. Wrong species.

He backs away, still offering the smile, then turns and
HURRIES DOWN the corridor to huddle with four other
Selays. Riker fingers his throat ruefully, goes to a
computer interface on a nearby wall and touches it.

RIKER
Riker to security chief.

TASHA'S COM VOICE
Yar here.

RIKER
Security squad to the Engineering
Deck. The Selays are playing hide
and seek down here -- obviously
with the Anticans --
(rubs throat)
-- and it's a lethal game. I want
them returned to their quarters
under guard.

TASHA'S COM VOICE
Right away, sir.
(hesitantly)
And are you... aware sir, the
captain expects you to take a
medical exam?

RIKER
I'll do it later.

87 OMITTED

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 46.

88 INT. READY ROOM - ANGLE ON PICARD

He is working feverishly at an o.s. personal Viewscreen,
absorbing the information at an intense rate. A CHIME
SOUNDS, and he looks up as though he is not sure at
first what it means. Then he registers and:

PICARD
Come.

89 ANGLE TO INCLUDE BEVERLY

The doors slide OPEN, and Beverly ENTERS. She is in
medical "blues." She is trying to appear relaxed and
confident, but nagging thoughts run around her mind
asking about why she is really here.

PICARD
What do you want?

BEVERLY
I have the results of the exams
you ordered.

She offers a record tape, he tosses it aside and leans
back in his chair... content and confident.

90 OMITTED

91 TWO SHOT - BEVERLY AND PICARD

BEVERLY
You don't care to inspect them?

Picard ignores her, she picks up her courage, moves
closer.

BEVERLY
Please, are you Jean-Luc?

Slowly, Picard looks up, aware of both her and her
physical closeness. He touches her hand. A long
hesitation, then gently:

PICARD
He is here.

BEVERLY
The Jean-Luc I know?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FOUR 47.

91 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(nods)
And more.

BEVERLY
The "more" frightens me...

PICARD
And elates us. We wish you could
understand the glorious adventures
ahead.

BEVERLY
You and... ?

PICARD
Soon we'll both be home.

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT FOUR

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 48.

ACT FIVE

FADE IN:

92 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise slows to impulse power as it heads for
the large energy pattern "Cloud" which can be seen in
far b.g.

RIKER (V.O.)
(troubled)
First officer's log, supplemental.
On the orders of... Captain
Picard, we have returned to the
vicinity of the energy pattern
"cloud." I am personally
convinced that something from this
"cloud" now shares...

93 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE SHOT

All officers at their regular duty stations, except for
Picard, who is not present. Riker is in the command
chair.

RIKER (V.O.)
(continuing)
... the captain's mind. But there
seems to be nothing we can do...
at least within regulations.
There have been no actions
warranting relieving Captain
Picard. And our medical
personnel, while dubious about
his condition, are not prepared
to certify the captain's
incapacity.

At the Conn position, Geordi turns to look back at
Riker.

GEORDI
Approaching the "cloud," sir.

RIKER
Very well, Mister La Forge. Bring
us to within ten thousand
kilometers and hold us there.

GEORDI
Aye, sir.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 49.

93 CONTINUED:

Picard ENTERS from his Ready Room. Riker gets out of
the command chair.

RIKER
Shall we begin the scientific
tests that you wanted, sir?

PICARD
(smiles)
They are already underway.

94 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

The energy pattern "shape" spreads out across the reach
of space, as we saw it earlier.

95 EMPHASIZING PICARD

as he looks at the viewscreen. His face is transformed,
showing longing and even a kind of love. Then he turns
to the bridge.

PICARD
I have an announcement for the
entire bridge.

96 PICARD AND VIEWER (OPTICAL)

Reaction and concern from all on the bridge as Picard
moves to stand in front of the viewscreen.

PICARD
As many of you suspected...
(indicating "cloud"
image)
... when our ship passed through
the edge of this, it accidentally
carried off a sentient being... one
much like these energy patterns
we're seeing here.

Picard moves toward Worf.

97 VARIOUS ANGLE ON PRINCIPALS

as Picard moves to the helm.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 50.

97 CONTINUED:

PICARD
A frightening experience for any
intelligent being. As if a great
claw reached down and scooped up
any of you from your home world.
Drawn into the energy pathways
of this vessel...
(to Worf)
... it found its way to you, Worf,
frantic at being carried from its
home. Recognizing you as
sentient beings, it pleaded for
help.

98 SHOT OF COMMAND AREA

Picard moving toward where Beverly stands nearby.

PICARD
... but in ways you could not
understand... going desperately
from one to another of you...
then discovering the computer
intelligence in the ship's memory
circuits.
(nods)
Simplistic intelligence, but it
furnished a way to slow this
Enterprise thing that had captured
it.
(toward Riker)
And it very much regrets the
accidental death of Engineer Singh
during this...

TROI
(interrupting)
Captain, do you exist in
combination with the entity?

RIKER)
Is it in control of you, sir?

PICARD)
(that smile again)
By the time we combined...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 51.

99 REACTION ANGLES

as the bridge crew hears him admit the entity is now
part of him.

PICARD
... We had learned much about each
other... our passion for
exploration... for the unknown.
We found we had similar
dreams... and it offered your
captain a way to realize them
beyond any human expectation.

RIKER
Captain, I must speak to you
privately...now.

DATA
I understand. As an energy
pattern free of the limitations
of matter... it might travel
anywhere, at any velocity...

RIKER
(angry)
Captain, did you hear me?

DATA
(intent on Picard)
Sir, I see no way for you to
journey with an energy form.

PICARD
(ignoring Riker)
Isn't there?

TROI
(reacting to a thought)
Maybe... just maybe...
(to Riker)
He's planning to beam both the
entity and himself into that
"cloud."

PICARD
(nods)
The transporter need not pattern
your captain back into matter...
we'll beam energy only...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 52.

100 ANGLE INCLUDING BEVERLY

reacting in some disgust and anger at his words and
expression now.

PICARD
(ecstatic)
... and we will become...
(pleased look)
... a combined energy pattern of
that life form.

101 ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA - INCLUDING BEVERLY

as Picard turns to Riker.

PICARD
A resignation from this command
and from Starfleet has been
appropriately recorded...

RIKER
(moving in; firmly)
I refuse to allow this, sir.

PICARD
Oh? Under what Fleet regulation?
Does this resignation threaten
the ship and its company in any
way?

BEVERLY
(moving in)
Captain Picard, you are now
relieved from duty. I judge you
disabled...

102 ANGLE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)

moving his hand toward a nearby panel.

BEVERLY (O.S.)
... mentally incapacitated...

Picard's hand touches the panel and WE SEE the familiar
BLUE GLOW, at which the panel becomes a BRILLIANT
DISPLAY OF LIGHT on a darkened bridge. Surprised VOICES
and GROANS, all matched to:

RIKER (O.S.)
Security! Help me restrain the
Captain...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 53.

102 CONTINUED:

TROI (O.S.)
This is blinding me...

TASHA (O.S.)
... Where is he? These light
flashes...

103 FULL ON BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

BLINDING BLUE LIGHT from all panels, ENERGY FORMS
(lightning-like) flings some of the bridge crew to the
floor...

WORF
Captain! I'll help you if you'll
let me...

104 ANGLE AT TURBOLIFT (OPTICAL)

as in the darkness WE MAKE OUT a Figure ENTERING the
turbolift, the door CLOSING.

105 ANGLE ON RIKER (OPTICAL)

Intermittently ILLUMINATED BY THE BRILLIANT FLASHES as
he gets zapped again, then again, struggling to reach
the captain's panel.

RIKER
Hang on to the captain, someone!

He makes it, hits the RED ALERT switch... which SOUNDS
THE KLAXON and begins the RED ALARM LIGHTS BLINKING.

106 INT. CORRIDOR

Darkened too, but the FLASHING RED LIGHTS illuminate
Picard turning into the Transporter Room.

107 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

where a crewman lies unconscious. Picard, relieved to
see the crewman stirring somewhat, makes a setting on
the transporter panel, jumps to the platform as WE HEAR
the TRANSPORTER SOUND begin.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 54.

108 FULL ON TRANSPORTER PLATFORM

as the TRANSPORTER EFFECT takes Picard away from the
Enterprise.

109 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise hovers even closer to the "cloud,"
waiting.

110 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

Riker is in the command chair -- all others at their
usual stations except Tasha who ENTERS very concerned
and upset. Riker glances around the bridge, then:

TASHA
The Transporter Chief has no idea
of what the coordinates were, sir.

GEORDI
He's just out there "somewhere?"
How can we settle for that?

RIKER
Give me a choice, then.

DATA
Still no readings, no sign of
anything.

Long hesitation; then, Riker sighs.

RIKER
Mister La Forge, it's time to
set a course for Parliament. Warp
eight.

GEORDI
We're really leaving him... ?

RIKER
I've waited as long as possible,
Lieutenant.

111 EMPHASIZING TROI

She stiffens suddenly in her seat, reaching out to grab
Riker's arm.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 55.

111 CONTINUED:

TROI
Wait! I'm feeling... yes, it's
the captain!
(concentrating)
The captain only. He's out there
alone!

RIKER
The entity... has it abandoned him?

TROI
Aban... ? No, the combination just
wasn't possible out there.
(intently; fast)
The Captain's in trouble, sir;
we must beam him back!

RIKER
Beam him back as what? He's
nothing but energy now.

112 ANGLE INCLUDING GEORDI

turning to Riker, matching his pace. Time may be
important to the Captain now.

DATA
Sir, the entity was caught by
the ship's circuitry -- the
captain might try to get in the
same way if he's in trouble!

RIKER
(to Geordi)
Move the ship in closer!

As Geordi turns, hurriedly doing so.

GEORDI
Moving in, sir. But where?

RIKER
No way to know. Let's hope he
can come part way himself.

113 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)

The Enterprise moving close, then closer.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 56.

114 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

showing Enterprise coming even closer -- the "cloud's"
energy patterns becoming visible.

115 REACTION SHOT

The helm officers, intent, hoping.

116 REACTION SHOT

The Command Area with Riker and Troi -- then Beverly
ENTERS with Wesley. She indicates her son to Riker,
questioningly. Riker nods, goes back to his intent
examination of the viewer.

RIKER
Troi, is there any way you can...
"get" a message to him?

TROI
(shakes head sadly)
I wish I could.

117 SHOT INCLUDING DATA

as he swivels toward Riker.

GEORDI
Sensors are monitoring our
perimeter, the ship's circuitry...
(shakes head)
Nothing, sir.

RIKER
(interrupting)
Take us into the edge of it, La
Forge.

As he looks toward the Main Viewer:

118 FULL ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

The "cloud" moving toward us -- then we're into it.

119 COMMAND AREA

Riker still intent on the viewer.

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 57.

119 CONTINUED:

WESLEY
Mom, is he gone for good?

Beverly shushes her son. He tries almost a whisper:

WESLEY)
(continuing)
The funny thing is, I... I sort
of liked him...

120 INCLUDING TASHA AND WORF (OPTICAL)

Worf is suddenly startled by a reading on his panel.

WORF
Sir! On my sensor controls...

A sudden BLUE GLOW APPEARS, like that which earlier
indicated the entity's presence. Followed by a CRACKLE
OF ENERGY which sees Worf stepping back, alarmed.

TROI
Something's here. I can feel it!

DATA
Just as before! Going to you
first, Worf...

GEORDI
(interrupting)
Something crazy on my viewer
circuits...
(looking toward Viewer)
Commander Riker!

Riker leaps toward Geordi's station.

121 FULL ON GEORDI'S VIEWER (OPTICAL)

An area of static is APPEARING. The STATIC IMAGE is
undefined at first but is becoming a "shape," although
not yet recognizeable.

121A INCLUDING COMMAND AND HELM AREAS

Very curious.

GEORDI
"Static?"

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 58.

121B FULL ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

The STATIC IMAGE as if with great effort, slowly forms
itself into a lop-sided IMAGE of the letter "P."

122 INCLUDING COMMAND AND HELM AREAS

Riker coming to his feet.

RIKER
"P" for Picard!

Data moves quickly toward Riker.

DATA
He's in the ship's circuitry!
Come to the Transporter Room.
Please!

Data HURRIES toward the turbolift. Then he turns.

DATA
(continuing)
There might be a way, sir! Hurry!

Riker decides to HURRY to the turbolift himself. He
joins Data and the turbolift doors CLOSE.

123 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

moving away, the "cloud" now in b.g.

124 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

where Data makes quick adjustments at the control
panel.

RIKER
This is a wild theory Data!

DATA
I knew we had to have the
captain's physical pattern here,
He was the last one beamed out.

RIKER
Is what you're thinking possible?

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 59.

124 CONTINUED:

DATA
Unknown at this time, sir. I
hope the captain remembers his
pattern is here.
(steps back)
If he has, his energy has moved
into the transporter relays by
now...

RIKER
(nods)
Wish we had some sign he's there.
(waits; then)
We've no choice but to risk it.

DATA
(nodding)
Energizing, sir!

125 SHOT INCLUDING TRANSPORTER PLATFORM

as Data engages the transporter. Riker waits...waits.

126 TWO SHOT OF RIKER AND DATA

watching anxiously, their disappointment building. They
exchange a worried look.

127 TRANSPORTER PLATFORM (OPTICAL)

The TRANSPORTER EFFECT builds slowly, a bit unevenly...
then firms up, finally MATERIALIZING PICARD. He looks
around, surprised.

PICARD
What the devil am I doing here?!

RIKER
(quietly)
Sounds like our Captain...

Picard begins MOVING OFF the platform.

DATA
But confused. This Picard-pattern
was formed before he went out
there...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 60.

127 CONTINUED:

PICARD
(to Riker)
What's happening to me, Number
One? I was ready to beam away...
somewhere... I remember talk of
an... an entity? But all that
seems so vague...

DATA
(to Riker)
I believe the Captain is now his
separate self, sir. A lot of what
happened is naturally missing...

PICARD
(interrupting)
Data, what nonsense are you
talking now? Is it still
"Sherlock Holmes?"

Data hesitates, exchanging a look with Riker who gives
an almost imperceptible nod.

DATA
Ah, yes. Indubitably, sir,
indubitably.

PICARD
(beginning to EXIT)
Well, at least get rid of that
damned pipe. It smells.

As the captain ALMOST EXITS, Riker intercepts him.

RIKER
Doctor Crusher asked me to steer
you past Sickbay. She says you've
looked very tired.

Tasha ENTERS hurriedly.

TASHA
Sorry Commander, but Security Team
Two reports they've discovered
a puddle of blood outside the
Selay Quarters and they can't
find one of the delegates and...

STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT FIVE 61.

127 CONTINUED: (2)

RIKER
(interrupting; annoyed)
Lieutenant, couldn't this have
waited a moment? We've got the
captain back.

TASHA
(to Picard)
Good to see you, sir. The problem
is that one of the cooks has just
been asked to broil Reptile for
the Anticans... and it looks like
the Selay delegate...

PICARD
Riker, with these "peace"
delegates and all, I do need some
rest. Take charge, Number One.

128 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

The "cloud" in far b.g. as WE SEE the Enterprise go into
WARP SPEED EFFECT.

FADE OUT.

END OF ACT FIVE
